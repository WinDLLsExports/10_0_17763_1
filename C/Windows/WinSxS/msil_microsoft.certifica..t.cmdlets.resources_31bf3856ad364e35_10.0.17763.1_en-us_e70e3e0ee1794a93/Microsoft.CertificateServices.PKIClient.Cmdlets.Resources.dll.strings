The password is incorrect. However, the PFX file you are importing is group-protected or has a null/empty password. Re-run the command without -Password parameter to unpack the PFX.
The policy is invalid 
The request object does not have information on where to find the enrollment server. You can set this information using the EnrollmentServerEndPoint property on the request object.
There are certificates in My store that have been replaced in the past. You can use the New-CertificateNotification Cmdlet with the RunTaskForExistingCertificates switch to generate notifications for those certificates to correct any configuration problems that you may already have on this machine.
There is no default enrollment policy server defined. Re-run the cmdlet and provide a specific url to use to enroll for a certificate
TImporting PFX files is not supported. Use Import-PfxCertificate to import PFX files.
