This command allows the TPM owner to change the TPM owner authorization value or the storage root key (SRK) authorization value.
This command allows the TPM owner to create a maintenance archive that enables the migration of data held by the TPM. This data includes the storage root key (SRK) and the TPM owner authorization.
This command allows the TPM owner to create a migration authorization ticket so that users can move keys without involvement of the TPM owner.

This command allows the TPM to migrate a blob (as generated by TPM_CreateMigrationBlob or TPM_CMK_CreateBlob) to a destination by re-encrypting it with a given public key.
This command certifies a loaded key (created by TPM_LoadKey2) with the public portion of another key. A TPM identity key may only certify non-migratable keys. Signing and legacy keys may certify all keys.
This command clears a revocable TPM endorsement key (generated by TPM_CreateRevocableEK) and resets the TPM, if it finds the correct authorization value for this reset. This command requires physical presence at the platform and cannot be run by the operating system.

This command completes a pending SHA-1 digest process, returns the resulting SHA-1 hash output, and incorporates this hash into a platform configuration register (PCR).
This command completes the transport session. If logging is turned on, this command returns a hash of all operations performed during session, as well as the digital signature of the hash.
This command creates a certifiable migration key blob that can be loaded onto another computer using the TPM_LoadKey2 command. This command is given a random number and the certifiable migration key's migration blob (as generated by TPM_CMK_CreateBlob).
This command creates a key blob that can be loaded onto another computer using the TPM_LoadKey2 command. This command is given a random number and the key's migration blob (as generated by TPM_CreateMigrationBlob).
This command creates the TPM endorsement key (EK). The user can also specify whether the EK can be reset, and can specify the authorization value necessary to reset this key (if this value is not to be generated by the TPM). This is an optional command that may not be supported by the computer manufacturer.
This command defines the operator authorization value. This command requires physical presence at the computer and cannot be run by the operating system.
This command delivers a wrapped TPM command to the TPM within a transport session. The TPM unwraps the command and then runs the command.
This command disables the TPM. This command requires physical presence at the computer and cannot be run by the operating system. Turning off the TPM involves disabling or deactivating the TPM (with TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated).
This command enables the TPM. This command requires physical presence at the computer and cannot be run by the operating system. Turning on the TPM involves enabling and activating the TPM (with TPM_PhysicalSetDeactivated).
This command establishes a transport session that can be used to confidentially transmit shared secrets, encryption keys, and session logs to the TPM (using TPM_ExecuteTransport).
This command generates a secure asymmetric certifiable migration key using the authorization ticket for one or more migration authorities (as generated by TPM_CMK_ApproveMA).
This command generates an authorization session handle for the Delegate-Specific Authorization Protocol (DSAP) used to securely pass delegated authorization data to the TPM and the information the TPM needs to track this authorization session handle.
This command generates an authorization session handle for the Object-Independent Authorization Protocol (OIAP) used to securely pass authorization data to the TPM, as well as the information the TPM needs to track this authorization session handle.
This command generates an authorization session handle for the Object-Specific Authorization Protocol (OSAP) used to securely pass authorization data to the TPM, as well as the information the TPM needs to track this authorization session handle.
This command informs the TPM that it may complete the self test of all TPM functions that were not tested during the power-on self test.
This command is similar to the TPM_Quote command, but includes locality information to provide a more complete view of the current computer configuration.
This command is superseded by having the TPM_TakeOwnership command automatically disable reading the public portion of the endorsement key (EK) using the TPM_ReadPubek command.
This command loads a key into TPM so that the owner can set other actions on it. These actions include wrap, unwrap, bind, unbind, seal, unseal, and sign.
This command loads the computer manufacturer's public key into the TPM for use during maintenance. This command can only be run once and should be run before a computer ships.
This command must follow the TPM_Init command. It transmits additional computer information to the TPM about the type of reset that is occurring at the time of the call.
This command performs a full self-test and returns an authenticated value if the test passes. This command is not upgraded for version 1.2 of the TPM.
This command releases all resources associated with existing authorization sessions. This command is not upgraded for version 1.2 of the TPM.
This command releases secrets previously sealed by the TPM if integrity, platform configuration, and authorization checks succeed.
This command returns a signed digest that is a combination of the contents of a specified platform configuration register (PCR) and some specified external data. The digest is signed with a loaded key.
This command returns the public portion of the TPM endorsement key. This command is disabled when ownership of the TPM is taken using the TPM_TakeOwnership command.
This command saves a loaded resource outside the TPM. After successful execution of this command the TPM automatically releases the internal memory for sessions but leaves keys in place.
This command sets the reference to the owner authorization that the TPM uses when executing an OIAP or OSAP session. Use this command only when you need to provide owner delegation functionality for legacy code that does not support DSAP.
This command starts the process of calculating a SHA-1 digest. This command must be followed by execution of TPM_SHA1Update or the SHA-1 process is invalidated.
This command takes ownership of the TPM with a new owner authorization value, derived from the owner password. Among other conditions that must be met before this command can run, the TPM must be enabled and activated.
This command will be added to the local block list, but the blocking will not take effect due to group policy on this computer.C
This command writes a specified value to a defined non-volatile storage area, if it finds the required authorization for that area.
This is the first command sent by the computer. During the boot process, this command is sent to the TPM. This command cannot be run by software.
