The chain of virtual hard disks is broken. The system cannot locate the parent virtual hard disk '{0}' for the child virtual hard disk '{1}'.
The connection to the remote computer was lost, possibly due to network connectivity problems. Try connecting to the remote computer again.
The ID of the differencing disk does not match the ID of the parent virtual hard disk. If you continue, this action might corrupt the virtual hard disk file and could result in data loss.
The operation is not available.
The operation is not supported.
'The operation on computer '{0}' failed.
The operation timed out.
'The server ran out of available memory.
This occurs if the current state of the virtual machine does not support shut down. For example, integration services might not be installed. If the virtual machine is running an operating system that supports shut down, ensure that integration services are installed and enabled in the virtual machine settings.
