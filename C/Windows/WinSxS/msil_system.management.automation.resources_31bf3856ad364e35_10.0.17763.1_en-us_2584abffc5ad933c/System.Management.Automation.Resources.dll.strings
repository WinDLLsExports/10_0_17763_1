              If CmdletParameterSet is ommited, then the name of the cmdlet parameter set is auto-generated based on the name of the method.
              If this parameter is ommited, then the cmdlet parameter belongs to all parameter sets.

Cannot perform call.
Cannot process argument because the value of argument "{0}" is not valid. Change the value of the "{0}" argument and run the operation again.
Cannot process argument because the value of argument "{0}" is not valid. Valid values are "Global", "Local", or "Script", or a number relative to the current scope (0 through the number of scopes where 0 is the current scope and 1 is its parent). Change the value of the "{0}" argument and run the operation again.
Cannot process argument because the value of argument "{0}" is out of range. Change argument "{0}" to  a value that is within range.
Cannot process the #requires statement because it is not in the correct format.
Cannot process the argument because the argument value is not a string. The values of parameter arguments that have the ArgumentTransformationAttribute specified should be strings.
Cannot process the cmdlet instance because the cmdlet instance is in use by another pipeline. Please contact Microsoft Customer Support Services.
Cannot process the cmdlet number. The ReadFromCommand function must specify the Id of a cmdlet that has already been added to the pipeline. Please contact Microsoft Customer Support Services.
Cannot process the drive name because the drive name contains one or more of the following characters that are not valid: ; ~ / \ . :
Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type defines multiple parameter sets. Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry.
Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type defines the {1} cmdlet parameter with a {2} attribute parameter that is ignored.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry.

Cannot process the ObjectModelWrapper attribute. The {0} type is not derived from the following class: {1}.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML specifies a valid type in the ObjectModelWrapper attribute and retry.
Cannot process the returned information because the information returned from the provider's Start method was for a different provider than the one passed.
Cannot process variable because variable path '{0}' resolved to multiple items. You can get or set the variable value only one item at a time.
Cannot read the output of the ReadFromCommand and ReadErrorQueue functions because another cmdlet is already reading that output. Please contact Microsoft Customer Support Services.
Cannot remove item {0}: {1}
Cannot remove the Windows PowerShell snap-in {0} because it is a system snap-in. Verify the name of the snap-in that you want to remove, and then try again.
Cannot remove the Windows PowerShell snap-in {0} because it is not loaded. Verify the name of the snap-in that you want to remove, and then try again.
Cannot remove variable {0} because it is constant or read-only. If the variable is read-only, try the operation again specifying the Force option.
Cannot remove variable {0} because the variable has been optimized and is not removable. Try using the Remove-Variable cmdlet (without any aliases), or dot-sourcing the command that you are using to remove the variable.
Cannot resolve alias '{0}' because it refers to term '{1}', which is not recognized as a cmdlet, function, operable program, or script file. Verify the term and try again.
Cannot resume the job that has an ID of {0}. Resuming jobs is not supported for some job types. For more information about support for resuming jobs, see the Help topic for the job type.
Cannot retrieve dynamic parameters for the cmdlet. Dynamic parameter '{1}' specified parameter set '{6}' which was not statically defined for this cmdlet. New parameter sets may not be defined as dynamic parameters, although dynamic parameters may join parameter sets which were statically defined.
Cannot retrieve the job definition '{0}' because path '{1}' refers to a '{2}' provider path.  Change the path parameter to a file system path.
Cannot retrieve the job definition '{0}' because path '{1}' resolves to multiple file paths.  Change the path parameter so that it is a single path.
Cannot run the pipeline because the first cmdlet in the pipeline is trying to read input from the results of a preceding cmdlet. Either modify the first cmdlet, remove the first cmdlet, or add to the pipeline the cmdlet whose output is required by the first cmdlet, and then try running the pipeline again.
Cannot serialize the credential. If this command is starting a workflow, the credentials cannot be persisted, because the process in which the workflow is started does not have permission to serialize credentials. 
Cannot set the location because path '{0}' resolved to multiple containers. You can only the set location to a single container at a time.
Cannot set the new item value because the parameter "value" must be of the type ProviderInfo when "type" is specified as "provider".
Cannot set the TypeTable data unless the runspace pool is in either the Disconnected or BeforeOpen states.  Current state is {0}.
Cannot suspend the job that has an ID of {0}. Suspending jobs is not supported for some job types. For more information about support for suspending jobs, see the Help topic for the job type.
Cannot use '&' to invoke in the context of binary module '{0}'. Specify a non-binary module after the '&' and try the operation again.

TFunction declarations are not allowed in restricted language mode or a Data section.
The "{0}" argument does not contain a valid Windows PowerShell version. Supply a valid version number and then try the command again.
The "{1}" validation script for the argument with value "{0}" did not return a result of True. Determine why the validation script failed, and then try the command again.
The #requires statement must be in one of the following formats:
The {0} argument is greater than the maximum allowed range of {1}. Supply an argument that is less than or equal to {1} and then try the command again.
The {0} argument is less than the minimum allowed range of {1}. Supply an argument that is greater than or equal to {1} and then try the command again.
The {0} cmdlet defines the {1} parameter set more than once.  Verify that the Cmdlet Definition XML does not have duplicate parameter set names and retry.
The '{0}' command in the {1}' module was imported, but because its name does not include an approved verb, it might be difficult to find. For a list of approved verbs, type Get-Verb.
The '{0}' command in the {2}' module was imported, but because its name does not include an approved verb, it might be difficult to find. The suggested alternative verbs are "{1}".
The '{0}' command was found in the module '{1}', but the module could not be loaded. For more information, run 'Import-Module {1}'.
The {0} is obsolete. {1}
The {0} key has no value.
The {0} key is not valid.
The '{0}' module cannot be imported because its manifest contains one or more members that are not valid. The valid manifest members are ({1}). Remove the members that are not valid ({2}), then try to import the module again.
The '{0}' operator failed: {1}.
The {0} parameter is already specified in the {1} section. Contact your administrator to make sure that {0} is specified only once.
The {0} property is recursive.
The '{0}' resource can only be used once per configuration, and therefore cannot have a name. Remove '{1}', and then run the script again.
The ampersand (&) character is not allowed. The & operator is reserved for future use; wrap an ampersand in double quotation marks ("&") to pass it as part of a string.
The argument "{0}" does not belong to the set "{1}" specified by the ValidateSet attribute. Supply an argument that is in the set and then try the command again.
The argument cannot be validated because its type "{0}" is not the same type ({1}) as the maximum and minimum limits of the parameter. Make sure the argument is of type {1} and then try the command again.
The argument for the Version parameter is not valid. Specify a valid Windows PowerShell version, in the format major.minor version.
The argument has a null value, or an element of the argument collection contains a null value. Provide a collection that does not contain any null values, and then try the command again.
The argument is null, empty, or an element of the argument collection contains a null value. Supply a collection that does not contain any null values and then try the command again.
The assignment expression is not valid. The input to an assignment operator must be an object that is able to accept assignments, such as a variable or a property.
The attribute cannot be set because attributes are not supported. Only the following attributes can be set: Archive, Hidden, Normal, ReadOnly, or System.
The automatic variable $PSDefaultParameterValues was ignored because it is not a valid hashtable object. It must be of the type IDictionary.
The body of the Data section is not valid. The Data section body can be only a convert-* command invocation optionally enclosed by an If statement.
The character length ({1}) of the argument is too short. Specify an argument with a length that is greater than or equal to "{0}", and then try the command again.
The character length of the {1} argument is too long. Shorten the character length of the argument so it is fewer than or equal to "{0}" characters, and then try the command again.
The class name '{0}' does not match '{1}', the name of the file in which it is defined. Rename either the file name to match the class name or vice versa
The client did not receive a response for a Close operation in the specified time interval. This can happen when a command is not responding to a Stop message in a timely manner.
The client did not receive a response for a signal operation in the specified time interval. This can happen when a command is not responding to a Stop message in a timely manner.
The cmdlet "{0}" or the alias "{1}" cannot be present when "{2}","{3}","{4}" or "{5}" keys are specified in the session configuration file.
The cmdlet name "{0}" cannot be validated because it is not in the correct format. Cmdlet names must include a verb and a noun separated by a "-", such as "Get-Process".
The command {0} was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: "{1}". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.
The command cannot be completed. Script invocation is not supported in this session configuration. This can occur if the session configuration is in no-language mode.
The command cannot find a job with the instance identifier {0}. Verify the value of the InstanceId parameter, and then try the command again.
The command cannot find the job because the job name {0} was not found. Verify the value of the Name parameter, and then try the command again.
The command cannot remove the job because it does not exist or because it is a child job. Child jobs can be removed only by removing the parent job.
The command cannot remove the job with the job ID {0} and the instance identifier {1} because the job is not finished. To remove the job, first stop the job or use the Force parameter.
The command cannot remove the job with the job ID {0} and the name {1} because the job is not finished. To remove the job, first stop the job, or use the Force parameter.
The command cannot remove the job with the job ID {0} because the job is not finished. To remove the job, first stop the job, or use the Force parameter.
The command cannot retrieve the jobs of the specified computers. The ComputerName parameter can be used only with jobs created by using Windows PowerShell remoting.
The command could not be retrieved because the ArgumentList parameter can be specified only when retrieving a single cmdlet or script.
The command name '{0}' from the module '{1}' contains one or more of the following restricted characters: # , ( ) {{ }} [ ] & - / \ $ ^ ; : " ' < > | ? @ ` * % + = ~
The configuration name '{0}' is not valid. Standard names may only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), period (.), hyphen (-) and underscore (_). The name may not be null or empty, and should start with a letter.
The console file is not valid. Multiple entries were found for the element PSConsoleFile. Only one entry is supported for this version.
The contents of file {0} might have been changed by an unauthorized user or process, because the hash of the file does not match the hash stored in the digital signature. The script cannot run on the specified system. For more information, run Get-Help about_Signing.
The credential is invalid.
The current deserialized object size of the data received from the remote client computer exceeded the allowed maximum object size. The current deserialized object size is {0}. The allowed maximum object size is {1}.
The current deserialized object size of the data received from the remote server exceeded the allowed maximum object size. The current deserialized object size is {0}. The allowed maximum object size is {1}.
The current session does not support debugging; operation will continue.
The current Windows PowerShell host is: '{0}' (version {1}). The module '{2}' requires a minimum Windows PowerShell host version of '{3}' to run.
The data in the command exceeded the maximum size that is allowed by the session configuration. The allowed maximum is {0} MB. Change the input, use a different session configuration, or change the "{1}" and "{2}" properties of the session configuration on the remote computer.
The debugger detach command is not applicable.  The detach command only applies when debugging jobs and runspaces with the Debug-Job or Debug-Runspace cmdlets.
The directory '{0}' already exists.  Use the -Force parameter if you want to overwrite the directory and files within the directory.
The Disconnect operation is not supported on the server.  The server must be running Windows PowerShell 3.0 or greater for remote runspace pool disconnection support.
The disconnection operation is not supported on the remote computer. To support disconnecting, the remote computer must be running Windows PowerShell 3.0 or a later version of Windows PowerShell.
The EndpointConfiguration with the {0} identifier is not in a valid initial session state on the remote computer. Contact your Windows PowerShell administrator, or the owner or creator of the endpoint configuration.
The expression after '{0}' in a pipeline element produced an object that was not valid. It must result in a command name, a script block, or a CommandInfo object.
The extension '{0}' is not a valid module extension. The supported module extensions are '.dll', '.ps1', '.psm1', '.psd1', '.cdxml' and '.xaml'. Correct the extension then try adding the file '{1}' again.
The field or property: "{0}" for type: "{1}" differs only in letter casing from the field or property: "{2}". The type must be Common Language Specification (CLS) compliant.
The file {0} is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170
The FileSystem provider supports credentials only on the New-PSDrive cmdlet. Perform the operation again without specifying credentials.
The first exception was "{0}" with stack trace "{1}".
The following name or alias defined in $PSDefaultParameterValues for this cmdlet resolves to multiple parameters: {0}. The default has been ignored.
The ForEach() operator could not find a member '{0}' on the target object. Please verify that the named member exists and then try running your script again.
The format of the resource reference '{0}' in the exclusive list for resource '{1}' is not valid. An exclusive resource name should be in the format '<typename>\<name>', with no spaces.
The format of the resource reference '{0}' in the Requires list for resource '{1}' is not valid. A required resource name should be in the format '[<typename>]<name>', with alphanumeric characters, spaces, '_', '-', '.' and '\'.
The format of the specified snap-in name was not valid.  Windows PowerShell snap-in names can only contain alpha-numeric characters, dashes, underscores and periods. Correct the name and then try the operation again.
The FragmentIDs of the same object must be in sequence, incrementally changing by 1. This can happen if the fragments are not properly constructed by the remote computer. The data might also have been corrupted or changed.
The function or command was called as if it were a method. Parameters should be separated by spaces. For information about parameters, see the about_Parameters Help topic.
The generic collection type [{0}] passed to ForEach() has too many type arguments. Please change the specified type to be a generic collection with only one type argument then try running your script again.
The 'Global' and 'Scope' parameters cannot be specified together. Remove one of these parameters, and then try running the command again.
The hashtable describing a module contains one or more members that are not valid.  The valid members are ({0}). Remove the members that are not valid ({1}), then try again.
The Help content XSD file cannot be found in {0}. Verify that the XSD file exists at the specified location, and then retry the command.
-The HelpInfoURI {0} does not start with HTTP.
