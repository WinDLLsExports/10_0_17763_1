If you are executing this cmdlet from a Network Controller node, please ensure that the node is connected to the Internet and try again after some time. In case you are executing this cmdlet from a client node, please ensure all windows updates available for Remote Server Administration Tools are installed in the client node.

Use -AllowAdditionalData parameter to return all the server side data without any conversion.
Failed to type cast the data sent from the server side endpoint to entity type '{0}'. Hence the retuned data will remain as PSCustomObject.
