The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
The system cannot protect plain text input. To suppress this warning and convert the plain text to a SecureString, reissue the command specifying the Force parameter. For more information ,type: get-help ConvertTo-SecureString.

WCannot get the ACL because the necessary method, GetSecurityDescriptor, does not exist.
Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope.  Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of {0}. Type "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List" to view your execution policy settings. For more information please see "Get-Help Set-ExecutionPolicy".
WThis Windows PowerShell Snap-In contains cmdlets to manage Windows PowerShell security.
