The {0} cmdlet requires the following commands in the remote session: Get-Command, Get-FormatData, and Select-Object. The following commands are used, but optional: Get-Help, and Measure-Object. Verify that the remote session includes the required commands, and then try again.
The {0} parameter is not necessary for a member of type "{1}", and should not be specified. Do not specify the {0} parameter when updating this member type.
The {0} parameter should not be null or an empty string for a member of type "{1}". Specify a non-null value for the {0} parameter when updating this member type.
The cmdlet cannot run because the following conflicting parameters are specified: Body and InFile. Specify either Body or Infile, then retry.  
The cmdlet cannot run because the following conflicting parameters are specified: Credential and UseDefaultCredentials. Specify either Credential or UseDefaultCredentials, then retry.
The cmdlet cannot run because the following conflicting parameters are specified: ProxyCredential and ProxyUseDefaultCredentials. Specify either ProxyCredential or ProxyUseDefaultCredentials, then retry.
The cmdlet cannot run because the following conflicting parameters are specified: Session and SessionVariable. Specify either Session or SessionVariable, then retry.
The cmdlet cannot run because the following parameter is missing: OutFile. Provide a valid OutFile parameter value when using the PassThru parameter, then retry.
The cmdlet cannot run because the following parameter is missing: Proxy. Provide a valid proxy URI for the Proxy parameter when using the ProxyCredential or UseDefaultProxyCredentials parameters, then retry.
The cmdlet cannot run because the 'Json.Net' module cannot be loaded. Import the module manually or set the $PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference variable to enable module auto loading. For more information, see 'get-help about_Preference_Variables'.
The command cannot be run because using the AsHashTable parameter with more than one property requires adding the AsString parameter.
The ConvertTo-Json and ConvertFrom-Json cmdlets require the installation of the .NET Client Profile, sometimes called the .NET extended profile.
The email cannot be sent because no SMTP server was specified. You must specify an SMTP server by using either the SmtpServer parameter or the $PSEmailServer variable.B

The operation has timed out.
The parameter NotePropertyName cannot take values that could be converted to the type {0}. To define the name of a member with those values, use Add-Member, and specify the member type.
The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again. 
The SecondValue parameter is not necessary for a member of type "{0}", and should not be specified. Do not specify the SecondValue parameter when you add members of this type.
The SecondValue parameter should not be null for a member of type "{0}". Specify a non-null value for the SecondValue parameter when adding members of this type.
The Value and SecondValue parameters should not both be null for a member of type "{0}". Specify a non-null value for one of the two parameters.
The Value parameter should not be null for a member of type "{0}". Specify a non-null value for the Value parameter when adding members of this type.
This command cannot be run because the file path '{0}' is not valid. Please provide a valid file path and then run the command.
This command cannot be run because the prefix value in the Namespace parameter is null. Provide a valid value for the prefix, and then run the command again.
