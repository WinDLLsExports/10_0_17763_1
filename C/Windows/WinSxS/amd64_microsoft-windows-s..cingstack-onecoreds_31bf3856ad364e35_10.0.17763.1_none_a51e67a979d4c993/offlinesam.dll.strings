A backward compatibility group which allows read access on all users and groups in the domain
A fatal error occurred trying to transfer the SAM account database into the directory service. A possible reason is the SAM account database is corrupt.
A pool of account-identifiers (RIDs) has been invalidated. This may occur in the following expected cases:%n1. A domain controller is restored from backup. %n2. A domain controller running on a virtual machine is restored from snapshot. %n3. An administrator has manually invalidated the pool. %nSee http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226247 for more information.
A pool size for account-identifiers (RIDs) that was configured by an Administrator is greater than the supported maximum. The maximum value of %1 will be used when the domain controller is the RID master. %nSee http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225963 for more information.

An error occurred while creating new default accounts for this domain.  This maybe due to a transient error condition. The task will retry periodically until success and will log this message again in a week if the problem persists.
An initial account-identifier pool has not yet been allocated to this domain controller. A possible reason for this is that the domain controller has been unable to contact the master domain controller, possibly due to connectivity or network problems. Account creation will fail on this domain controller until the pool is obtained.

SAM failed to restore the database to an earlier state. SAM has shutdown. You must reboot the machine to re-enable SAM.
SAM failed to start the TCP/IP or SPX/IPX listening thread
SAM failed to write changes to the database. This is most likely due to a memory or disk-space shortage. The SAM database will be restored to an earlier state. Recent changes will be lost. Check the disk-space available and maximum pagefile size setting.
SAM was configured to not listen on the TCP protocol.

The %1 package failed to update additional credentials for user %2.  The error code is in the data of the event log message.
The account %1 cannot be converted to be a domain controller account as its object class attribute in the directory is not computer or is not derived from computer. If this is caused by an attempt to install a pre Windows 2000 domain controller in a Windows 2000 domain or later, then you should pre-create the account for the domain controller with the correct object class.
The account %1 could not be upgraded since there is an account with an equivalent name.
The account krbtgt was renamed to %1 to allow the Kerberos security package to install.
The account with the rid %1 could not be added to group %2.
The account with the sid %1 could not be added to group %2.
The account-identifier allocator was unable to assign a new identifier. The identifier pool for this domain controller may have been depleted. If this problem persists, restart the domain controller and view the initialization status of the allocator in the event log.
The account-identifier-manager object creation completed. If the record data for this event has the value zero, the manager object was created. Otherwise, the record data will contain the NT error code indicating the failure. The failure to create the object may be due to low system resources, insufficient memory, or disk space.
The attempt to check whether group caching has been enabled in the Security Accounts Manager has failed, most likely due to lack of resources. This task has been rescheduled to run in one minute.
The certificate issuance policy descriptor %1 cannot be linked to group %2. Issuance policies can be linked through the attribute msDS-OIDToGroupLink only to universal, security-enabled groups that have an empty membership. You should ensure that this group meets these requirements.%nThe error is %5.
The certificate issuance policy descriptor %2 is linked through its attribute msDS-OIDToGroupLink to a group that is not a security group, has members, or is not universal. The error is %6.%nAn issuance policy should be linked to a security identifier (SID) of a group that is security enabled, does not have members, and is universal. Users who are authenticating using certificates that are issued according to this policy may be denied access to some resources. The distinguished name (also known as DN) of the group that does not meet these requirements is %3.
The certificate issuance policy that is represented by OID %2 does not have a link to a security identifier (SID), or this link cannot be read. The link is represented by the attribute msDS-OIDToGroupLink on the msPKI-Enterprise-Oid object that represents the issuance policy. This certificate will not be associated with a corresponding SID, and the user may be denied access to some resources if you have resources whose access is restricted based on this issuance policy.
The certificate that is used for authentication does not have an issuance policy descriptor corresponding to OID %1 in the Active Directory database. This certificate will not be associated with a corresponding security identifier (SID), and the user may be denied access to some resources if you have resources whose access is restricted based on this issuance policy. The error is %2.
The computed account identifier is invalid because it is out of the range of the current account-identifier pool belonging to this domain controller. The computed RID value is %1. Try invalidating the account identifier pool owned by this domain controller. This will make the domain controller acquire a fresh account identifier pool.
The domain controller is booting to directory services restore mode.
The domain controller is starting a request for a new account-identifier pool.
The error "%2" occurred when trying to create the well known account %1. Please contact PSS to recover.
The following invalid claims issued to user %1 have been dropped: %2.
The global maximum for account-identifiers (RIDs) has been increased to %1. %n See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=233329 for more information including important operating system interoperability requirements.
The group caching option in the Security Accounts Manager has now been properly updated.  Group caching is enabled.
The group caching option in the Security Accounts Manager has now been properly updated. Group caching is disabled.
The maximum account identifier allocated to this domain controller has been assigned. The domain controller has failed to obtain a new identifier pool. A possible reason for this is that the domain controller has been unable to contact the master domain controller. Account creation on this controller will fail until a new pool has been allocated. There may be network or connectivity problems in the domain, or the master domain controller may be offline or missing from the domain. Verify that the master domain controller is running and connected to the domain.
The maximum domain account identifier value has been reached. No further account-identifier pools can be allocated to domain controllers in this domain.
The password notification DLL %1 failed to load with error %4. Please verify that the notification DLL path defined in the registry, %2%3, refers to a correct and absolute path (<drive>:\<path>\<filename>.<ext>) and not a relative or invalid path. If the DLL path is correct, please validate that any supporting files are located in the same directory, and that the system account has read access to both the DLL path and any supporting files.  Contact the provider of the notification DLL for additional support. Further details can be found on the web at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245898.
The registry security descriptor is malformed: %1.%nRemote calls to the SAM database are being restricted using the default security descriptor: %2.%nFor more information please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=787651.
The request for a new account-identifier pool failed. The operation will be retried until the request succeeds. The error is %n " %1 "
The request for a new account-identifier pool has completed successfully.
The requested modification for group %1 could not be performed. This is because this group is linked through msDS-OIDToGroupLinkBl to a certificate issuance policy descriptor. Such groups should be security enabled, they should not have any members, and they should be universal.%nThe requested operation was %4.%nThe error is %5.
The SAM database attempted to clear the directory %1 in order to remove files that were once used by the Directory Service. The error is in record data. Please have an admin delete these files.
The SAM database attempted to delete the file %1 as it contains account information that is no longer used.  The error is in the record data. Please have an administrator delete this file.
The SAM database was unable to lockout the account of %1 due to a resource error, such as a hard disk write failure (the specific error code is in the error data) . Accounts are locked after a certain number of bad passwords are provided so please consider resetting the password of the account mentioned above.
The Security Account Database detected that the well known account %1 does not exist. The account has been recreated.  Please reset the password for the account.
The Security Account Database detected that the well known group or local group %1 does not exist. The group has been recreated.
There are two or more objects that have the same account name attribute in the SAM database. The system has automatically renamed object %1 to a system assigned account name %2.
There are two or more objects that have the same SID attribute in the SAM database. The Distinguished Name of the account is %1. All duplicate accounts have been deleted. Check the event log for additional duplicates.
There are two or more well known objects that have the same SID attribute in the SAM database. The Distinguished Name of the duplicate account is %1. The newest account will be kept, all older duplicate accounts have been deleted. Check the event log for additional duplicates.
This event is a periodic update on the remaining total quantity of available account-identifiers (RIDs). The number of remaining account-identifiers is approximately: %1. %n%nAccount-identifiers are used as accounts are created, when they are exhausted no new accounts may be created in the domain. %n%nSee http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=228745 for more information.
