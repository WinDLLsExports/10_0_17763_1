The hypervisor did not enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines because HyperThreading is enabled and the hypervisor core scheduler is not enabled. To enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines, enable the core scheduler by running "bcdedit /set hypervisorschedulertype core" from an elevated command prompt and reboot.
The image %1 could not be accessed (status %2).
The image %1 could not be loaded (status %2).
The image %1 could not be read (status %2).
The image %1 failed code integrity checks, and cannot be used.
