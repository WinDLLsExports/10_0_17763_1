The RepetitionInterval parameter cannot have a value of zero unless the RepetitionDuration parameter also has a zero value. A zero value removes repetition behavior from the Job trigger.
The scheduled job definition {0} cannot be removed because one or more instances are currently running.  You can remove and stop all running instances by using the Force parameter.
The scheduled job definition {0} could not be saved because one of the values in the ArgumentList parameter cannot be converted to XML. If possible, change the ArgumentList values to types that are easily converted to XML, such as strings, integers, and hash tables. {1}
There is no entry in Task Scheduler for scheduled job definition {0}.  A new Task Scheduler entry has been created for this scheduled job definition.
