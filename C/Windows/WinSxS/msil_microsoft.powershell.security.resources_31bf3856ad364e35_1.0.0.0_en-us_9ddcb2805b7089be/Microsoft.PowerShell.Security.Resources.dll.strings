The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic. Do you want to change the execution policy?
The specified command ({0}) is not in any of the directories in the PATH defined by your system administrator. You can only run commands from these directories: {1}.
The system cannot protect plain text input.  To suppress this warning and convert the plain text to a SecureString, reissue the command specifying the Force parameter.  For more information, type: "get-help ConvertTo-SecureString"

Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope.  Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of "{0}". Type "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List" to view your execution policy settings. For more information, please see "Get-Help Set-ExecutionPolicy."
WThis Windows PowerShell snap-in contains cmdlets to manage Windows PowerShell security.
