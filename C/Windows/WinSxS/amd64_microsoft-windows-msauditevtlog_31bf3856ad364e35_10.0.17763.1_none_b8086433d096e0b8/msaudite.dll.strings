This authentication package will be used to authenticate logon attempts.
This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event.  The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.%n
This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service.  The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.%n
This logon process will be trusted to submit logon requests.
This may indicate a either network or hardware problem or that a replay attack is in process. Check your IPsec peer network for errors.  To check for a replay attack shutdown the peer device and check if these messages persist.  If the messages persist it may indicate a replay attack.:%n
This package will be notified of any account or password changes.
Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
