The cmdlet could not verify that the path '{0}' can be accessed by the cluster. If the cluster uses a non-Microsoft file system, or you are sure that the path can be accessed by the cluster, run the cmdlet again and use the -AllowUnverifiedPaths parameter to continue.
The destination host is not configured for live migration. Use the Enable-VMMigration cmdlet to modify the Hyper-V settings on the destination host to enable migration.
The Ethernet resource pool must have at least one port ACL configured on a network adapter that is connected to this pool, before the pool's resource metering can be enabled.
The format of the World Wide Name parameter contains an error. Specify the World Wide Name as a value with 16 hexadecimal digits, such as C003FF0000FFFF00.
The frequency at which changes will be sent for extended replication should be greater than the frequency for primary replication on the Replica virtual machine.
The given network adapter was not previously associated with a resource pool. Use Set-VMNetworkAdapter to connect it to an ethernet resource pool instead.
The MaximumAmountPerNUMANodeBytes should be a multiple of 2 MB (2*1024*1024 bytes). Specify a valid value, such as 512 MB or 2 GB.
The name specified for the integration service is not valid. Use wild cards or specify one of the valid integration service names: 'Time Synchronization', 'Heartbeat', 'Key-Value Pair Exchange', 'Shutdown', 'VSS', or 'Guest Service Interface'.
The node '{0}' specified in '{1}' does not contain the domain name '{2}' of the cluster. Correct the name of this node and try again.
The nodes for this Replica cluster are configured to receive replication on different ports. Use '{0}' to change the ports. You can clear the values in '{0}' to use same port for all nodes of the cluster.
The operation cannot be performed because Hyper-V Replica Broker is not configured. Configure the Hyper-V Replica Broker using the Failover Cluster Manager and try again.
The operation is not available.
The operation is not supported.
The operation timed out.
The parameter is not valid.
The path '{0}' specifies a disk that is in another cluster group. To move the disk into the virtual machine's cluster group, use the Failover Cluster Manager or the Move-ClusterResource cmdlet.
The path '{0}' specifies a disk that is still in available storage and has not been moved into the virtual machine's cluster group. To move the disk, use the Failover Cluster Manager or the Move-ClusterResource cmdlet.
The port for Hyper-V Replica Broker '{0}' is not specified in '{1}'. Include the Hyper-V Replica Broker in the '{1}' and try again.
The requested operation cannot be performed because it requires the Guest Service Interface integration service, which is not available.
The resource pool is empty.
'The server ran out of available memory.
The source host is not configured for live migration. Use the Enable-VMMigration cmdlet to modify the Hyper-V settings on the source host to enable migration.
The specified Replica server is part of a failover cluster. For clusters, a valid Hyper-V Replica Broker is required for the Replica server name. Create the Hyper-V Replica Broker using the Failover Cluster Manager and try again.
The specified Replica server is part of a failover cluster. For clusters, use the name of the Hyper-V Replica Broker as the Replica server name. The Hyper-V Replica Broker for the cluster is "{0}".
The specified Replica server is the name of a failover cluster. For clusters, use the name of the Hyper-V Replica Broker as the Replica server name. Hyper-V Replica Broker for the cluster is "{0}".
The specified switch type is not valid. Either it was used to specify an external switch or to try to enable SR-IOV on an internal or private switch. To create an external switch, use the NetAdapterInterfaceDescription parameter. SR-IOV is valid only on external switches.
The string is not a valid GUID.
The virtual machine {0} is using certificate based authentication. A new certificate needs to be specified for reversing replication. Specify a valid certificate thumbprint and try again.
This host is not configured to allow migrations. This means that virtual machines or their storage cannot be moved to or from this host.
This operation is not supported on a clustered virtual machine. To perform this operation, remove the virtual machine from the cluster and then try again.
