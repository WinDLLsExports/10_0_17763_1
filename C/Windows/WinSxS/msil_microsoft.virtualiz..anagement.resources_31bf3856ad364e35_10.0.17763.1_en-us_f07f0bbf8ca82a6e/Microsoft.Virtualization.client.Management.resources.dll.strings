The chain of virtual hard disks is broken. The system cannot locate the parent virtual hard disk '{0}' for the child virtual hard disk '{1}'.
The connection to the remote computer was lost, possibly due to network connectivity problems. Try connecting to the remote computer again.
The file '{0}' already exists.
The Hyper-V Management Tools could not access an expected WMI class on computer '{0}'. This may indicate that the Hyper-V Platform is not installed on the computer or that the version of the Hyper-V Platform is incompatible with these management tools.
The ID of the differencing disk does not match the ID of the parent virtual hard disk. If you continue, this action might corrupt the virtual hard disk file and could result in data loss.
The operation is not available.
The operation is not supported.
The operation timed out.
'The server ran out of available memory.
'The WMI object path '{0}' is not valid.
This occurs if the current state of the virtual machine does not support reboot and shut down. For example, integration services might not be installed. If the virtual machine is running an operating system that supports reboot and shut down, ensure that integration services are installed and enabled in the virtual machine settings.
