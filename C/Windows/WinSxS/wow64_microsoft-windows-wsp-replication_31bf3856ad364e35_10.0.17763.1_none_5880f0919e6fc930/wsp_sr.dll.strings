Detaches a Storage Spaces based virtual disk from the system. This operation is similar to Hide, however there is no need for target and initiator configuration since everything is done locally. Detaching a Storage Space will result in it's corresponding disk object to be suprise removed from the system. Note that detaching can happen in response to certain failure and warning conditions (such as failing redundancy, or thin provisioning capacity limits being reached).

If CannotPoolReason contains 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representing the vendor defined reason why this physical disk cannot be added to a concrete pool. This property must be NULL if CannotPoolReason does not contain 1 - 'Other'.
If it is a member of a concrete pool, the health and operational statuses should be reset to 1 - 'Healthy', and 1 - 'OK', respectively. If any additional errors are detected after Reset, the health and operational statuses should reflect these new errors. 
If MaskingValidInitiatorIdTypes contains the value 1 - 'Other', this field is used to enumerate the other valid initiator id types for this storage subsystem.
If OperationalStatus contains 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representing the vendor defined operational status. This property must be NULL if OperationalStatus does not contain 1 - 'Other'.
If RunAsJob is set to TRUE and this method takes a while to execute, this parameter returns a reference to the storage job used to track the long running operation.
If set to a valid access path, the system will attempt to use this path as a way to access the local volume. If the access path could not be set, or this parameter was left NULL, a new access path will be automatically assigned.
If set to TRUE, this instructs the physical disk to enable its indication LED. The indication LED should remain enabled until a second call to Maintenance is made with this parameter specified as FALSE.
If specified, allocation of this virtual disk's storage is limited to the physical disks in the list. These physical disks must already be added to this storage pool.
If the operation that this storage job was tracking has failed, the provider will set this with an error code defined by the method that invoked the operation. If this job tracked a background task, the error code can be set to any valid Storage Management error code as defined in the value map below. If there was no error, this property must be set to 0 - 'Success'. This property should be NULL until the operation has completed.
If the physical disk is not a member of a concrete pool, then this method should not only reset the health and operational statuses, but it should return the disk into a state where it is usable as storage for a concrete pool. For example: If a physical disk had become missing and then has reappeared (after it has been replaced) this physical disk is expected to be in the primordial pool only with an operational status indicating its data is either split or unrecognized. Calling Reset should clear the physical disk of any data, remove any remaining ties to its former concrete pool, and return the disk to a healthy, usable state.
If the SMP is of type 2 - 'SMI-S', this field contains the protocol, computer host name, and port of the SMI-S server. This field will be NULL otherwise.
If the virtual disk's Usage field is set to 1 - 'Other', this field must contain a description of the vendor or user defined usage. If Usage is not set to 1 - 'Other', this field must not be set.
If this field is set to FALSE, the storage pool is a concrete pool. These pools are subject to all of the management operations defined on the storage pool class. This includes creation, deletion, creation of virtual disks, etc.
If this field is set to TRUE, the storage pool is primordial. A primordial pool, also known as the 'available storage' pool is where storage capacity is drawn and returned in the creation and deletion of concrete storage pools. Primordial pools cannot be created or deleted. 
If this property is set to TRUE, the operating system does not assign a drive letter automatically when the partition is discovered. This is only honored for GPT disks and is assumed to be FALSE for MBR disks. This attribute is useful in storage area network (SAN) environments.
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is a shadow copy of another partition. This attribute is used by the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS). This attribute is an indication for file system filter driver-based software (such as antivirus programs) to avoid attaching to the volume. An application can use this attribute to differentiate a shadow copy partition from a production partition. For example, an application that performs a fast recovery will break a shadow copy virtual disk by clearing the read-only and hidden attributes and this attribute. This attribute is set when the shadow copy is created and cleared when the shadow copy is broken.
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is not detected by the mount manager. As a result, the partition does not receive a drive letter, does not receive a volume GUID path, does not host volume mount points, and is not enumerated by calls to FindFirstVolume and FindNextVolume. This ensures that applications such as disk defragmenter do not access the partition. The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) uses this attribute on its shadow copies.
If TRUE the file server will support continuously available file shares.
If TRUE the server supports file share creation.
If TRUE the share data transmission is encrypted.
If TRUE the share is continuously available.
If TRUE, all resiliency settings will be copied from the primordial pool and added to a concrete pool upon its creation. If FALSE, the storage pool should copy the setting specified in the ResiliencySettingNameDefault parameter of CreateStoragePool. If no name was given, the resiliency setting specified by the primordial pool's ResiliencySettingNameDefault property should be used.
If TRUE, storage pools on this subsystem support capacity expansion through adding more physical disks.
If TRUE, storage pools on this subsystem support the replacement or removal of physical disks by use of the RemovePhysicalDisk method on the storage pool instance.
If TRUE, the CreateVirtualDisk method on the storage subsystem is supported.
If TRUE, the storage job will be automatically deleted after a short time interval.
If TRUE, the storage pool should clear (zero out) physical disks that are removed from the pool.
If TRUE, the storage provider supports the use of the DeviceNumbers parameter of the CreateMaskingSet and AddVirtualDisk methods.
If TRUE, the storage subsystem supports showing and hiding (masking) a virtual disk to a host initiator through the Show/Hide methods of the virtual disk and by the use of masking sets.
If TRUE, the storage subsystem will automatically retire missing physical disks in this storage pool and replace them with hot-spares or other available physical disks (in the storage pool).
If TRUE, the subsystem will only allow one initiator to be added to a masking set.
If TRUE, this field instructs the storage provider (or subsystem) to automatically pick what it determines to be the best number of columns for the virtual disk. If this field is TRUE, then the NumberOfColumns parameter must be NULL.
If TRUE, this storage job represents an automated background task initiated by the storage subsystem. For all user / management initiated operations, this value should be set to FALSE.
If TRUE, this storage pool supports data deduplication.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the ability to create new concrete storage pools from one or more physical disks. If FALSE, either the subsystem uses pre-created storage pools, or it does not support storage pools.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the ability to create new storage tiers. If FALSE, either the subsystem uses pre-created storage tiers, or it does not support storage tiers.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the creation of tiered virtual disks.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the deletion of its storage pools.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the deletion of storage tiers.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the modification of the storage tier friendly name.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the resizing of storage tiers.
If TRUE, this virtual disk will only be attached to the system if an explicit call is made to the Attach method. Note that this property is specific to Storage Spaces.
If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representation of the vendor defined usage for the storage pool. This property must be NULL if Usage is not set to 1 - 'Other'.
If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this parameter takes in the string representation of a vendor defined usage for this storage pool. This parameter must not be set if Usage is a value other than 1 - 'Other'.
If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this parameter takes in the string representation of a vendor defined usage for this virtual disk. This parameter must not be set if Usage is a value other than 1 - 'Other'.

Indicates whether or not there are tiers associated with this virtual disk.
Indicates whether the physical disk's identification LEDs are active or not. This is typically used in maintenance operations.
Indicates whether the provider should pick up the auto write cache size
Indicates whether the virtual disk is available for read and/or write access
Indicates whether this physical disk can be added to a concrete pool or not
Indicates whether this physical disk is partially consumed by a system or service whose use is outside of normal storage pool operations.
Indicates whether this virtual disk is a snapshot of another virtual disk
Indicates which address formats can be inferred by the storage provider and subsystem when working with initiator ids.
Indication
Individual settings of the resiliency setting can be overridden using the NumberOfDataCopies, PhysicalDiskRedundancy, NumberOfColumns, and Interleave parameters. If these parameters are not used, the defaults from the resiliency setting will be used. These overrides will not persist back to the particular resiliency setting instance; however some storage providers may choose to create a new resiliency setting instance to capture this new configuration. If any of the goals specified in the override parameters are out of range, or are not supported by the storage pool, an error will be returned.

ObjectId
ObjectId is a mandatory property that is used to opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of a class. ObjectIds must be unique within the scope of the management server (which is hosting the provider). The ObjectId is created and maintained for use of the Storage Management Providers and their clients to track instances of objects. If an object is visible through two different paths (for example: there are two separate Storage Management Providers that point to the same storage subsystem) then the same object may appear with two different ObjectIds. For determining if two object instances are the same object, refer to the UniqueId property.

Storage arrival events are used whenever a storage object is added or created.
Storage Capacity Problem
Storage departure events are used whenever a storage object is removed or deleted.
Storage jobs represent long running operations on a storage subsystem. These operations can either be user-initiated through the various management interfaces defined by this MOF, or automatically by intelligent storage subsystems.
Storage modification events are used when the underlying state of an object has changed. Not all properties should be tracked (for example AllocatedSize may change so frequently that sending events would be impractical). At a minimum, an event should be sent any time an objects HealthStatus or OperationalStatus properties change.

UniqueId
UniqueId is a mandatory property that is used to uniquely identify a logical instance of a storage subsystem's object. This value must be the same for an object viewed by two or more provider instances (even if they are running on seperate management servers). UniqueId can be any globally unique, opaque value unless otherwise specified by a derived class.
UniqueIdFormat
UniqueIdFormat indicates the type of identifier used in the UniqueId field. The identifier used in UniqueId must be the highest available identifier using the following order of preference: 8 (highest), 3, 2, 1, 0 (lowest). For example: if the physical disk device exposes identifiers of type 0, 1, and 3, UniqueId must be the identifier of type 3, and UniqueIdFormat should be set to 3.
