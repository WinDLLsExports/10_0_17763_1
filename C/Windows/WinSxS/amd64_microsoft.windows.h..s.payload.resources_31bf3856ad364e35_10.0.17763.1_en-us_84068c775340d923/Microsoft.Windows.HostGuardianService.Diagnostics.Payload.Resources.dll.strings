AThe forced attestation request on the fallback URL '{0}' failed. 
Attempted to retrieve information about the host process but failed.  Process will continue like normal but the host process will still wait for a debugger to attach as requested.
Attestation evaluated this host as insecure but did not provide any additional information.  This is frequently caused by failing to configure any attestation policies with the Host Guardian Service.  Other diagnostics may be able to identify the root cause.
Attestation failed because the host could not communicate with the HGS cluster.  Verify that the cluster is fully operational and can be reached on the appropriate HTTP/HTTPS ports.
Attestation failed because the service could not be reached, however the host could be contacted.  Verify that the HGS service is running correctly and that the service URL's configured are correct.
Attestation failed for an unknown reason and no additional information was provided.  This usually means that the service could not be reached or an attempt could never be made.  Other diagnostics that test the client and network may reveal the root cause.

Could not acquire private key information for certificate with thumbprint "{0}" and subject "{1}".  This can indicate the certificate lacks the required private key or the private key is stored using a special key storage provider such as a hardware security module.  Ensure the certificate has been properly imported with a private key and that the underlying key storage provider is working correctly if the key is not stored in the standard Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider.  If all of the above requirements are met, then the key may function correctly with the Host Guardian Service but this cannot be confirmed using this version of diagnostics.  If there is a newer version available in a newer edition of Windows or via Windows Update, it may be able to handle this key type.  Specific error: "{2}"

The Attestation policy could not be loaded from the exported attestation state. This can occur when no policies have been configured on the HGS server.  Add baseline and/or code integrity policies and try again.
The attestation signing certificate with the subject "{0}" and thumbprint "{1}" is expired.  Register a valid certificate with both the attestation and key protection services to ensure hosts will be able to boot shielded VM's.
The attestation signing certificate with the subject "{0}" and thumbprint "{1}" is not registered with the Key Protection Service or has been disabled.  Use Add-HgsKeyProtectionAttestationSignerCertificate to register the certificate.
The certificate used for signing new health certificates is registered and valid, however the certificates listed above may have been used to sign existing health certificates causing guarded hosts with cached health certificates to fail.  Register the above certificates with KPS or have new health certificates issued to all guarded hosts.
The certificate with subject "{0}" and thumbprint "{1}" has no private key.  A private key is required for this certificate to function.  This can happen when the first HGS server has been initialized using certificate thumbprints.  Manually replicate the entire certificate, including the private key, to this HGS node and try again.
The client is currently configured in local mode.  In most cases this is unintentional and you should properly configure the client to use a Host Guardian Service cluster with Set-HgsClientConfiguration.  If this was done on purpose, it is safe to ignore this warning.
The client is not capable of performing a Secure Boot.  Check if the hardware meets UEFI Specifications Version 2.3.1, Errata C or higher, and is a UEFI Computer.
The code integrity policy currently installed does not match the policy recorded at boot time.  Restart the system to finish activating the new policy.
The code integrity policy has been installed but is not active.  You must restart the host after installing or updating the policy.
The collector did not pass verification despite reporting success.  This can indicate a version mismatch between the trace file and the diagnostic module.
The collector was not found.  Ensure the name was typed correctly.  This can also indicate that hosts are using different versions of diagnostics and some lack this particular collector.  It is safe to ignore this result if you intend to run different versions of diagnostics across your fabric.  Otherwise, update all hosts to the same version and try again.
The diagnostic did not run on the host {0} as it used its fallback attestation URL to attest. Fallback only occurs when there is an issue communicating with the primary HGS instance. Other diagnostics may contain indicators of the underlying problem.
The fallback URL '{0}' is identical to its corresponding primary URL. This is not a useful practice, as the fallback HGS server is only contacted when there are connectivity issues reaching the primary, and thus the fallback attempt will face similar issues.
The format of the access control entry is not supported by this version of diagnostics.  Unable to validate the permissions assigned to the object.
The guarded host {0} is configured to reach the URL "{1}", but no HGS servers are configured with that IP address.  You may not have specified all HGS nodes when running diagnostics or there is truly no server configured at that address.
The guarded host {0} is configured to use a loopback address in its service URL's.  This may function in demo or proof-of-concept environments but should never be used under normal circumstances.
The host "{0}" resolves {1} to a different set of IP addresses than the other hosts.  This is not a recommended practice and could mean some hosts will not have access to the entire HGS cluster.
The host "{0}" will have its remote session hosted in the process ({1}:{2}) and wait for a debugger to attach before proceeding.
The host cannot attest because it's TCG log cannot be verified.  This can indicate a problem with the system's firmware, the TPM itself, or other hardware components.  In some cases, this can be caused by utilizing an out-of-date Net Boot Program (NBP) and configuring the host to attempt PXE boot first.  If this is the case, update any PXE boot servers on your network (such as WDS) to use an updated NBP.
The host cannot attest because virtual secure mode could not be detected.  Please ensure that the Isolated User Mode feature is installed and enabled, and that this is a physical machine (not a virtual machine).
The host cannot connect to the HGS server at {0}.  Verify that the network is operating correctly and that no firewalls are blocking the ports you have configured for HGS communication.
The host did not full boot, meaning that it has been put to sleep or hibernated since the last full restart.  Please restart the host.
The host does not have a TPM.
The Host Guardian Service is not set up to trust the domain "{0}", to which the client machine "{1}" is joined.  Active Directory-based attestation will fail for this machine.
The host is currently configured in local mode.  To use with an HGS cluster, specify service URL's using the Set-HgsClientConfiguration command.
The host uses secure boot settings (UEFI variables DB and DBX) that are not recognized by the attestation service.  Ensure that the secure boot variables have not changed and that a baseline policy with the latest secure boot settings is registered on the server.
The host was found to be a member of an authorized group but attestation reports that the host is unauthorized.  This usually indicates that this host is using a stale Kerberos ticket.  Please restart the host and try again.
The host's code integrity policy is not present or not recognized by the server.  Ensure a policy has been installed, the host has been restarted, and the policy is registered on the server with the Add-HgsAttestationCIPolicy command.
The IIS binding for "{0}" has no certificate associated with it that could be found.  This will cause HTTPS connections to fail, and can be caused by deleting certificates from the certificate store without updating the corresponding binding.
The non-routable meta IP address '{0}' is listed as a DNS Server for the interfaces with the following indexes: {1}.  This is usually evidence of an unknown or invalid configuration; if this was intentional, you may safely ignore this warning as long as some DNS server on the host can resolve the service name. 
The operating mode of the attestation client is unknown, thus this result may be unreliable.  Correct any communication problems between the host and the Host Guardian Service to determine the actual operation mode.
The private key container for the certificate with thumbprint {0} could not be found.  This could be caused by using a different key storage provider or even a hardware security module.

The server is using a high percentage of its memory, this can cause some requests to fail unexpectedly as the Host Guardian Service will refuse to start.  Memory usage must not exceed 95% and it is recommended that it should be less than 90%, actual usage is {0}%.
The service could not be found at the configured URL.  Verify the URL was entered correctly and that the server is operating correctly.
The service URL {0} specifies a hostname which is not a valid, registered DNS name.  The use of DNS names is recommended to enable more secure kerberos authentication and high availability.
The service URL's specified a host name "{0}" that is not a valid, registered DNS name.  This diagnostic only applies to service URL's which use DNS names.
The service URL's specified an invalid host name "{0}".  The host name must be a valid, registered DNS name to run this diagnostic.

You may not have specified all HGS nodes when running diagnostics, or your DNS infrastructure is not configured correctly.  It is recommended that you use a forwarder on your DNS server so that HGS can resolve the hostnames to all HGS cluster nodes automatically.
Your clients use different attestation service URL's.  Use Set-HgsClientConfiguration to correct the service URL configuration.
Your clients use different key protection service URL's.  Use Set-HgsClientConfiguration to correct the service URL configuration.
