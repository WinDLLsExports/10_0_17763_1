TGetting formatting & output information from remote session ... {0} objects received
The FileName parameter was not specified.  The FileName parameter is required when Import-LocalizedData is not called from a script file.
The object of type "{0}" is not valid or not in the correct sequence. This is likely caused by a user-specified "{1}" command which is conflicting with the default formatting.
The object written to the pipeline is an instance of the type "{0}" from the component's primary interop assembly. If this type exposes different members than the IDispatch members, scripts written to work with this object might not work if the primary interop assembly is not installed.
The objects grouped by this property cannot be expanded since there is a duplication of the key. Please give a valid property and try again.
The SecondValue parameter is not necessary for a member of type "{0}" and should not be specified. Do not specify the SecondValue parameter when adding members of this type.
The SecondValue parameter should not be null for a member of type "{0}". Specify a non-null value for the SecondValue parameter when adding members of this type.
The Value and SecondValue parameters should not both be null for a member of type "{0}". Specify a non-null value for one of the two parameters.
The Value parameter should not be null for a member of type "{0}". Specify a non-null value for the Value parameter when adding members of this type.
This command cannot be executed because the file path '{0}' is not valid. Please provide a valid file path and then run the command.
