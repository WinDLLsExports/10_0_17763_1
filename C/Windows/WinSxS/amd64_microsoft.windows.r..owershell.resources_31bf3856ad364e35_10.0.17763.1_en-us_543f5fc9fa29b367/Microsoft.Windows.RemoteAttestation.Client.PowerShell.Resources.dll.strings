The log of the last full boot could not be validated against the current platform configuration. The last boot must be a cold boot (not from sleep or hibernation). Also verify that the network boot program, for example wdsmgfw.efi from Windows Deployment Services, is up-to-date if the machine attempts a network boot prior to booting into the current OS.
