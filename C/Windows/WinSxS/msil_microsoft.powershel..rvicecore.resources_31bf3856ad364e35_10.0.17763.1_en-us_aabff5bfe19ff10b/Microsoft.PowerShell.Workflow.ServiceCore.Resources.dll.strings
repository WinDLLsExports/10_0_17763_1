The activity cannot continue running because an error occurred while importing dependent module(s) '{0}' specified for activity '{1}'.  To fix this problem, verify that the module exists on the computer. If the module is not required, remove references to the module from the activity.
The activity is not valid: {0}
The argument to -PSParameterCollection can not contain AsJob, JobName, InputObject or PSParameterCollection as entries. Remove the extra entries and try again.
The argument to -PSParameterCollection can only contain one entry where PSComputerName is set to '*'. Remove the extra entries and try again.
The input objects cannot be serialized. Serialized data is required to suspend and resume workflows. To resolve the error, verify that the values of all variables and parameters are of types that can be serialized.
The input objects cannot be serialized. This might prevent the workflow from being resumed correctly. The serialization error might indicate a problem with the data contract that is defined at the type or attribute level. To resolve the problem, verify that the values of all variables and parameters can be serialized. Serialization error is: {0}.
The PSCredential parameter is supported only when the PSComputerName or PSConnectionUri parameters are used. The PSCredential parameter has been ignored.
The PSParameterCollection parameter can only be used with AsJob, JobName and InputObject. Move the additional parameters to within the PSParameterCollection argument and try again.
The value of the PersistencePath parameter {0} exceeds the maximum allowed length. The persistence path should not be greater than {1} characters.
The workflow cannot be started because the compiled activity for the workflow was not found. Cache the workflow definition by calling DefinitionCache.Instance.Add.
The workflow definition has been recycled, because the workflow definition cache limit of {0} has been reached. Import the workflow or module again, and then retry the operation.
The workflow job cannot be resumed, either because persistence data could not be saved completely, or saved persistence data has been corrupted.  You must restart the workflow.
The workflow job cannot be suspended because it does not include checkpoints (also called persistence points). To make the workflow suspendable, use the PSPersist parameter of the workflow. To suspend the workflow forcibly, use the Force parameter of the Suspend-Job cmdlet.
The workflow job could not be created because the JobInvocationInfo does not contain a JobDefinition. Initialize the JobInvocationInfo with a JobDefinition to create a workflow job.
The workflow job could not be created because the JobInvocationInfo specifies a type other than WorkflowJobSourceAdapter. Correct the JobSourceAdapter type or verify that the correct type is being used.
The workflow job could not be created because the JobInvocationInfo was not properly initialized. Initialize the JobInvocationInfo with workflow information.
This PSWorkflowJob was recovered from another session in a suspended state. This can indicate that the workflow was interrupted by a process failure, or a system restart. Run Resume-Job to try resuming the workflow.
This workflow job cannot be suspended because there are no checkpoints (also called persistence points) in the workflow. To make the workflow job suspendable, add checkpoints to the workflow.
