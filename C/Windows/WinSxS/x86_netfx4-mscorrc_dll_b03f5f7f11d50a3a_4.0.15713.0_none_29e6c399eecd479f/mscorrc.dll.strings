A non marshalable COM component is being used from a different apartment/context then the one where it first entered the CLR. Since the component is non marshalable, it will be called directly from the current apartment/context. This may cause corruption or data loss if the component does not support being accessed from multiple threads at once. This is most likely caused by a faulty IMarshal implementation on the part of the COM component.

This is done to prevent the non COM visible base class from being constrained by the COM versioning rules.
A SafeHandle or CriticalHandle of type '%1$s' failed to properly release the handle with value 0x%2$p.

A UTC DateTime is being converted to text in a format that is only correct for local times. This can happen when calling DateTime.ToString using the 'z' format specifier, which will include a local time zone offset in the output. In that case, either use the 'Z' format specifier, which designates a UTC time, or use the 'o' format string, which is the recommended way to persist a DateTime in text. This can also occur when passing a DateTime to be serialized by XmlConvert or DataSet. If using XmlConvert.ToString, pass in XmlDateTimeSerializationMode.RoundtripKind to serialize correctly. If using DataSet, set the DateTimeMode on the DataColumn object to DataSetDateTime.Utc.

An attempt was made to change the apartment state of the thread to %1$s, but it has already been set to %2$s. When creating a new thread the apartment state shouldbe set before the thread is started. For the main thread of the application, the apartmentstate can be set by specifying either [STAThreadAttribute] or [MTAThreadAttribute] on themain method of the application. If the application really needs to attempt to set the apartment state on a running thread, Thread.TrySetApartmentState should be used and the return value should be consulted to determine if the operation was successful. Note that Thread.TrySetApartmentState will not fire the InvalidApartmentStateChange MDA.
An attempt was made to load an assembly from a network location which would have caused the assembly to be sandboxed in previous versions of the .NET Framework.

An attempt was made to retrieve a GCHandle from an invalid IntPtr cookie (0x%1$x). The cookie was most likely invalid because the cookie does not represent a GCHandle, the GCHandle has already been freed, the retrieval was attempted in the wrong AppDomain, or the GCHandle was marshaled to native code as a GCHandle but passed back into managed code as an IntPtr where a cast was attempted. Attempting to use an invalid pointer to reclaim a GC handle can cause unexpected exceptions, crashes, corruption or data loss. 
An early bound call (vtable call) was made on the following member of an auto dispatch class interface: '%1$s'. Early bound calls on members of auto dispatch class interfaces are not allowed. Please consider using an explicit interface as the default interface for the type. If a class interface must be called early bound, change it to auto dual. This can be accomplished by marking the class with the following attribute, located in the System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace: [ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]

An exception was caught but handled while releasing a COM interface pointer through Marshal.Release or Marshal.ReleaseComObject or implicitly after the corresponding RuntimeCallableWrapper was garbage collected.

While these types of exceptions are caught by the CLR, they can still lead to corruption and data loss so if possible the issue causing the exception should be addressedGThe first PInvoke call to export '%1$s' in module '%2$s' has been made.

An overlapped pointer (0x%1$p) may have been freed before the I/O operation completed. Freeing an overlapped pointer before the I/O operation completes will cause GC heap corruption when the I/O does complete. Note that this MDA may not represent an error if the overlapped operation did not start successfully
An overlapped pointer (0x%1$p) that was not allocated on the GC heap was passed via PInvoke to the Win32 function '%2$s' in module '%3$s'. If the AppDomain is shut down, this can cause heap corruption when the async I/O completes. The best solution is to pass a NativeOverlapped structure retrieved from a call to System.Threading.Overlapped.Pack(). If the AppDomain exits, the CLR will keep this structure alive and pinned until the I/O completes.

The assembly loaded from code base '%1$s' failed to load in the '%2$s' binding context of the AppDomain with ID %3$d. The cause of the failure was: %4$s
The assembly named '%1$s' was loaded from '%2$s' using the LoadFrom context. The use of this context can result in unexpected behavior for serialization, casting and dependency resolution. In almost all cases, it is recommended that the LoadFrom context be avoided. This can be done by installing assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache or in the ApplicationBase directory and using Assembly.Load when explicitly loading assemblies.
The assembly returned from the host store has a different strong name signature than the corresponding one in GAC. Assembly: '%1'ULoadFrom(), LoadFile(), Load(byte[]) and LoadModule() have been disabled by the host.&Failed to add file to AppDomain cache.sThe requested assembly version conflicts with what is already bound in the app domain or specified in the manifest.{The requested assembly name was neither found in the GAC nor in the manifest or the manifest's specified location is wrong.6Unexpected error while parsing the specified manifest.QThe given assembly name is invalid because a processor architecture is specified.
The assembly with display name '%1$s' failed to load in the '%2$s' binding context of the AppDomain with ID %3$d. The cause of the failure was: %4$s-Marshaling field '%1$s' from '%2$s' to '%3$s'
The assembly with display name '%1$s' loaded from code base '%2$s' failed to load in the '%3$s' binding context of the AppDomain with ID %4$d. The cause of the failure was: %5$s
The call to QI for interface '%1$s' with IID '%2$s' failed with HRESULT 0x%3$s (%4$s). One likely reason this failed is that the object does not have a proxy/stub dll properly registered.
The CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x%1$x to COM context 0x%2$x for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use pumping wait primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages during long running operations.
The CLR marshaler encountered an error while attempting to associate a SafeHandle with an unmanaged resource. This may cause the unmanaged resource to be leaked. The cause of the failure was: %1$s
The CLR marshaler encountered an error while attempting to release the reference to a SafeHandle it acquired in order to marshal the SafeHandle to an unmanaged pointer during a call from managed to unmanaged. This may cause the unmanaged resource the SafeHandle represents to be leaked. The cause of the failure was: %1$s
The CLR marshaler encountered an error while attempting to restore the thread culture after a call from unmanaged to managed where an LCID was used to specify the culture for the call. This will cause the thread's culture to remain set to the one associated with the LCID. The cause of the failure was: %1$s
The current thread used to have an apartment state of %1$s, but the application has CoUnitialized this thread and it is now %2$s. This may cause calls on RuntimeCallableWrappers representing some COM components to fail and may also cause COM component that are not multi-threaded to be accessed from multiple threads at the same time which can cause corruption or data loss.
