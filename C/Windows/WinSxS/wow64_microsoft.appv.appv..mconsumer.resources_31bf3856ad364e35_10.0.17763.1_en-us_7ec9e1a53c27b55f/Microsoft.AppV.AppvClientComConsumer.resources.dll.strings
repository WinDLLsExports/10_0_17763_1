The Embedded Script process was terminated because the timeout for this process was reached. RollbackOnError is set to true in the script definition and as a result, the current AppV Client operation was rolled back due to the script timeout. Please increase the value of the timeout in script definition.
The operation cannot be completed because at least one of the Virtual Processes in this Connection Group is currently in use. The publish operation will be attempted at a later time.
The operation could not be completed because the virtual environment is in use. You must exit all applications associated with the package or connection group. To exit all of the applications associated with the package or connection group, use the Stop-AppVClientPackage or Stop-AppVClientConnectionGroup cmdlets. 
The operation failed because a Side-by-Side assembly cannot be installed until the system is restarted. Please restart the system before proceeding.
The operation failed because it conflicted with another in-progress operation.  Once the other operation has completed, you can reattempt this command.
The operation failed because the package installation root directory already exists as a file and not a directory. You must delete this file or change the package installation root directory. To return the current package installation root use the Get-AppvClientConfiguration cmdlet. To change the package installation root directory use the Set-AppvClientConfiguration cmdlet.
The operation failed because the virtual COM settings for the packages in the connection group are not identical. Verify the virtual COM settings of the packages listed in the connection group and try again.
The operation failed because the virtual objects settings for the packages in the connection group are not identical. Verify the virtual objects settings of the packages listed in the connection group and try again.
The protocol for publishing server is unknown. Only 'HTTP://' and 'HTTPS://' protocols are supported. Please check the server settings and try again.
The reporting server or share location has not been specified.  You must specify the reporting server or share location using the following format: -URL <location>.
The specified configuration document is not valid.  Please verify that the document conforms to the appropriate schema and try again.
The value of the AppV Client Configuration setting used is too long. Please make sure that the value does not exceed max registry value length.
