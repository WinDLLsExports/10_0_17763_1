The collector did not pass verification despite reporting success.  This can indicate a version mismatch between the trace file and the diagnostic module.
The trace results format {0} is unsupported.  The diagnostic engine can only read trace results using format 1.0.0.0.  Recollect the traces using a supported version of the diagnostic engine and try again.
