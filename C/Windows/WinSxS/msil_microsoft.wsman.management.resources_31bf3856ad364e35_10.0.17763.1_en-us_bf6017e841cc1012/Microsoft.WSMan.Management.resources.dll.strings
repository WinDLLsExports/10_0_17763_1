CredSSP authentication allows the server to accept user credentials from a remote computer. If you enable CredSSP authentication on the server, the server will have access to the user name and password of the client computer if the client computer sends them. For more information, see the Enable-WSManCredSSP Help topic. 
CredSSP authentication allows the user credentials on this computer to be sent to a remote computer. If you use CredSSP authentication for a connection to a malicious or compromised computer, that computer will have access to your user name and password.

The {0} parameter cannot be used when the {1} parameter value is {2}. The {0} parameter can be used only when the {1} parameter value is {3}.
The configuration changes you made will only be effective after the WinRM service is restarted.  To restart the WinRM service, run the following command: 'Restart-Service winrm'
The RunAsPassword value cannot be removed. Remove the values for RunAsUser and RunAsPassword in PowerShell by calling the Clear-Item cmdlet with the value for -Path attribute equal to the value of RunAsUser.
The updated configuration is effective only if it is less than or equal to the value of global quota {0}. Verify the value for the global quota using the PowerShell cmdlet "Get-Item {0}".
The updated configuration might affect the operation of the plugins having a per plugin quota value greater than {0}. Verify the configuration of all the registered plugins and change the per plugin quota values for the affected plugins.
The value for RunAsPassword cannot be set without a value set for RunAsUser. Set the value for both RunAsUser and RunAsPassword in Powershell by calling the Set-Item cmdlet with the value for -Path attribute equal to the value of RunAsUser.
This command cannot be executed because the Connection URI is not in correct format. Please check the connection uri and Run your command again.
This command cannot be used because the configuration is corrupted. Run WinRM invoke Restore WinRM/config to restore the default configuration

This command modifies the RootSDDL setting for the WinRM service.  The RootSDDL stores the default security settings for any WinRM securable resource that does not specify its own SDDL. Changing the SDDL might affect security for many WinRM resources. Are you sure that you want to modify these default settings?
This command modifies the TrustedHosts list for the WinRM client. The computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be authenticated. The client might send credential information to these computers. Are you sure that you want to modify this list?
