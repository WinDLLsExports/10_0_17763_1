!Name2EE <module name> <type or method name>
!Name2EE <module name>!<type or method name>
!object <valid object pointer>
!ObjSearch <valid object pointer>
!ObjSize [<Object address>]
!ObjSize includes the size of all child objects in addition to the parent.
!PrintException [-nested] [-lines] [-ccw] [<Exception object address>] [<CCW pointer>]
!PrintException can display source information if available, by specifying the 
!PrintException prints the exception object corresponding to a given CCW pointer, 
!PrintException will notify you if there are any nested exceptions on the 
!ProcInfo [-env] [-time] [-mem]
!ProcInfo is not supported on a dump file.
!ProcInfo lists the environment variables for the process, kernel CPU time, as 
!RCWCleanupList [address]
!Root <valid object pointer>
!SaveModule <Base address> <Filename>
!StopOnException [-derived] 
!StopOnException helps when you want the Windows Debugger to stop on a 
!StopOnException.
!SyncBlk [-all | <syncblk number>]
!t$(H!t$ I
!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
!ThreadPool
!Threads [-live] [-special] 
!Threads command will also tell you which threads have nested exceptions.
!Threads lists all the mananaged threads in the process. 
!ThreadState value
!Token2EE <module name> <token>
!Token2EE among others.
!TraverseHeap [-xml] [-verify] <filename>
!TraverseHeap writes out a file in a format understood by the CLR Profiler. 
!U [-gcinfo] [-ehinfo] [-n] <MethodDesc address> | <Code address>
!VerifyHeap
!VerifyHeap is a diagnostic tool that checks the garbage collected heap for 
!VerifyObj <object address>
!VerifyObj is a diagnostic tool that checks the object that is passed as an 
!VMMap
!VMMap requires a full memory dump (.dump /ma) or a live process.
!VMMap traverses the virtual address space and lists the type of protection 
!VMStat
!VMStat requires a full memory dump (.dump /ma) or a live process.
"!DumpHeap -type Customer".
"!PrintException -nested".
