This state is published whenever the permissions of an active client have changed. Every client on the system receives it, and should run domain-specific logic to see what the impact is (e.g., reconnect location session when permission re-allowed).
This state is used to notify Geofence tracking state for the geofences added by the applications. TRUE if atleast one geofence is actively being tracked and FALSE if there are no geofences being tracked.

This system-scope event is signaled each time a user's desktop becomes ready.  Consider using WNF_SHEL_SESSION_LOGON_COMPLETE for a session-scoped version.
This system-scope event is signaled each time the shell attempts to start a local session on WCOS-based SKUs.  It carries the latest session ID. Everyone can read from it. Authenticated users can write to it.  Apps in general can read from it.  Apps with WINCAP_SHELL_EXPERIENCE_COMPOSER can write to it.
This WNF event fires when the MO discovery task state changes. It will send an 0x00000000 if not running and 0x00000001 if running.
This WNF event fires when the OEM discovery task state changes. It will send an 0x00000000 if not running and 0x00000001 if running.
This WNF event fires when the OEM, MO, and Device Hardware values change in the registry.
This wnf indicates for some types of devices if a lid, cover or enclosure around it is closed (zero value) or open (non-zero value).
This wnf indicates that a cortana capabilties have changed. The payload will be the changed capabilties. The below sids are the CShell compser, cortana app, and cortana test app sids
This wnf indicates that a variable in the settings environment has changed. The payload is the current sessionId.
This wnf indicates that the assistant state has changed, e.g Talking, idle, thinking, notification pending etc
This wnf is signaled everytime the Action Center/Cortana beacon state changes. Payload is an int mapping to an enum representing the new state.
This wnf is signaled everytime the user connects an autoplay device. The payload is the device id (VID and PID).
This wnf is signaled when Cortana's QuietMoment @Home inferred that the user has arrived of left home .
This wnf is signaled when WinLogon detects an automatic lock on logon sequence to optimize displaying the user lock screen when the shell is ready.
This wnf is signaled whenever active quiet hours profile/mode changes. The value is the restrictive level of an active profile and the restrictive level is unique per profile
This wnf is used for testing purposes.
This WNF state can be used by first party Apps / Services to determine when WPN platform is ready to handle app related requests like posting toast / tile and getting channel uri.
This WNF state indicates that USER_PLATFORM_READY was fired for a user in the current session. This is intended to provide a workaround for the inability to use RtlSubscribeWnfStateChangeNotification for a user other than the current process token. A process can register for this WNF and then poll the per-user WNF states under impersonation.
This WNF state indicates to users of WPN endpoints (except AppEndpoint) that platform is ready to use. This state can also be used to know if WPN platform restarted.
