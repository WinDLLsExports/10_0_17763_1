The driver attempted to reset the device and during this procedure a USB port reset was attempted 3 times but this failed. 
The driver attempted to reset the device and failed. This could be a symptom of a faulty adapter. 
The Lan9500 driver completed it's initialization successfully, (%1): %2 : %3.
The Node Address specified through the device's Advanced Properties is invalid (it is either multicast, broadcast) and will be disregarded.
The Node Address specified through the device's Advanced Properties is not localy administered address.
The request to reset the device was dismissed since the driver detected the device had been surprise removed.
Therefore advertised modes were restricted to 10Mbps modes. If advertising higher speeds is really required change the port your device is connected to a high speed capable USB port.
This could be a symptom of a faulty adapter.
This could be a symptom of a faulty device.
This could be a symptom of a faulty driver installation, please reinstall.
This device requires support for the Ethernet_802.3 Medium. 
This driver encountered an error when attempting to change the device power state. 
This driver encountered an error when receiving (multi packet). 
This driver encountered an error when receiving (single packet). 
This driver encountered an error while reading a register. 
This driver encountered an error while writing a register. 
This driver received an unexpected interrupt status code via its interrupt pipe. Please report this error to the manufacturer. 
This driver waited several seconds for a resource to be freed by the Windows Operating System when Windows should have done so, but this did not occur. In order to continue operation it disregarded this error, therefore potentially "leaking" this resource. 
This driver was unable to allocate an I/O workitem.
This driver was unable to allocate sufficient memory for this device to operate.
This driver was unable to initialize the USB section of the device.
This driver was unable to perform initialization on the device.
Translation
Try reinstalling the driver to fix this problem. If the issue persists this could be indicative of a hardware malfunction.
