The cluster object '{0}' is not a valid cluster group or virtual machine cluster resource. Run the command again and specify an object that represents a cluster group or virtual machine cluster resource.
The cmdlet could not verify that the path '{0}' can be accessed by the cluster. If the cluster uses a non-Microsoft file system, or you are sure that the path can be accessed by the cluster, run the cmdlet again and use the -AllowUnverifiedPaths parameter to continue.
The configuration of virtual machine '{0}' was not refreshed within cluster '{1}' because the 'Failover Cluster Module for Windows PowerShell' feature is not enabled.  The virtual machine's configuration can be refreshed manually using the Update-ClusterVirtualMachineConfiguration cmdlet or Failover Cluster Manager.
The destination host is not configured for live migration. Use the Enable-VMMigration cmdlet to modify the Hyper-V settings on the destination host to enable migration.
The device naming setting only applies to synthetic network adapters on Generation 2 virtual machines with configuration version 6.2 or above.
-The file name at "{0}" is not in GUID format.
The format of the World Wide Name "{0}" contains an error. Specify the World Wide Name as a value with 16 hexadecimal digits, such as C003FF0000FFFF00.
The Generation 1 virtual machine or snapshot "{0}" does not support the VMFirmware cmdlets. Use Get-VMBios and Set-VMBios instead.
The Generation 2 virtual machine or snapshot "{0}" does not support the VMBios cmdlets. Use Get-VMFirmware and Set-VMFirmware instead.
The Hyper-V module used in this Windows PowerShell session cannot be used for remote management of the server '{0}'. Load a compatible version of the Hyper-V module, or use Powershell remoting to connect directly to the remote server. For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=532650.
The node '{0}' specified in '{1}' does not contain the domain name '{2}' of the cluster. Correct the name of this node and try again.
The Numa-Aware placement is supported on synthetic network adapters on virtual machines with configuration version 8.4 or above.
The operation cannot be performed because Hyper-V Replica Broker is not configured. Configure the Hyper-V Replica Broker using the Failover Cluster Manager and try again. If you are using the IsBrokerOptional registry key, retry the operation directly from WMI or through a management suite of your choice.
The path '{0}' specifies a disk that is in another cluster group. To move the disk into the virtual machine's cluster group, use the Failover Cluster Manager or the Move-ClusterResource cmdlet.
The path '{0}' specifies a disk that is still in available storage and has not been moved into the virtual machine's cluster group. To move the disk, use the Failover Cluster Manager or the Move-ClusterResource cmdlet.
The port for Hyper-V Replica Broker '{0}' is not specified in '{1}'. Include the Hyper-V Replica Broker in the '{1}' and try again.
The source host is not configured for live migration. Use the Enable-VMMigration cmdlet to modify the Hyper-V settings on the source host to enable migration.
The specified Replica server is part of a failover cluster. For clusters, a valid Hyper-V Replica Broker is required for the Replica server name. Create the Hyper-V Replica Broker using the Failover Cluster Manager and try again. If you are using the IsBrokerOptional registry key, retry the operation using the recovery cluster node name directly from WMI or through a management suite of your choice.
The specified Replica server is part of a failover cluster. For clusters, use the name of the Hyper-V Replica Broker as the Replica server name. The Hyper-V Replica Broker for the cluster is "{0}".
The specified Replica server is the name of a failover cluster. For clusters, use the name of the Hyper-V Replica Broker as the Replica server name. Hyper-V Replica Broker for the cluster is "{0}".
This operation is not supported on a clustered virtual machine. To perform this operation, remove the virtual machine from the cluster and then try again.
