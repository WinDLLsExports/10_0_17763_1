TFunction declarations are not allowed in restricted language mode or a Data section.
The "#requires" statement must be in one of the following formats:
The "{0}" argument does not contain a valid Windows PowerShell version. Supply a valid version number and then try the command again.
The "{1}" validation script for the argument with value "{0}" did not return true. Determine why the validation script failed and then try the command again.
The {0} argument is greater than the maximum allowed range of {1}. Supply an argument that is less than {1} and then try the command again.
The {0} argument is less than the minimum allowed range of {1}. Supply an argument that is greater than {1} and then try the command again.
The '{0}' module cannot be imported because its manifest contains one or more members that are not valid. The valid manifest members are ({1}). Remove the members that are not valid ({2}), then try to import the module again.
The '{0}' operator failed: {1}.
The {0} parameter is already specified in the {1} section. Contact your administrator to make sure that {0} is specified only once.
The argument "{0}" does not belong to the set "{1}" specified by the ValidateSet attribute. Supply an argument that is in the set and then try the command again.
The argument cannot be validated because its type "{0}" is not the same type ({1}) as the maximum and minimum limits of the parameter. Make sure the argument is of type {1} and then try the command again.
The argument is null, empty, or an element of the argument collection contains a null value. Supply a collection that does not contain any null values and then try the command again.
The argument is null, or an element of the argument collection contains a null value. Supply a collection that does not contain any null values and then try the command again.
The argument length of {1} is too long. Shorten the length of the argument to less than or equal to "{0}" and then try the command again.
The attribute cannot be set because attributes are not supported. Only the following attributes can be set: Archive, Hidden, Normal, ReadOnly, or System.
The body of the Data section is not valid. The Data section body can be only a convert-* command invocation optionally enclosed by an If statement.
The Catch block is missing a type literal token after the comma. Remove the comma if only one type is referenced, or add another type.
The client did not receive a response for close operation in the specified time interval. This might happen when a command is not responding to a stop message in a timely manner.
The client did not receive a response for signal operation in the specified time interval. This might happen when a command is not responding to a stop message in a timely manner.
The close call failed.
The cmdlet name "{0}" cannot be validated because it is not in the correct format. Cmdlet names must include a verb and a noun separated by a "-", such as "Get-Process".
The command cannot find the job because the {0} name was not found. Verify the value of the Name parameter, and then try the command again.
The command cannot find the job because the {0} session identifier was not found. Verify the value of the Id parameter and then try the command again.
The command cannot find the job with the {0} instance identifier because the identifier was not found. Verify the value of the InstanceId parameter, and then try the command again.
The command cannot remove the job because it does not exist or because it is a child job. Child jobs can be removed only by removing the parent job.
The command cannot remove the job with the {0} session identifier and the {1} instance identifier because the job is not finished. To remove the job, first stop the job or use the Force parameter.
The command cannot remove the job with the {0} session identifier and the {1} name because the job is not finished. To remove the job, first stop the job, or use the Force parameter.
The command cannot remove the job with the {0} session identifier because the job is not finished. To remove the job, first stop the job, or use the Force parameter.
The command cannot retrieve the jobs of the specified computers. The ComputerName parameter can be used only with jobs creating using PowerShell remoting.
The command could not be retrieved because the ArgumentList parameter can be specified only when retrieving a single cmdlet or script.
The command name '{0}' contains one or more of the following restricted characters: # , ( ) {{ }} [ ] & - / \ $ ^ ; : " ' < > | ? @ ` * % + = ~
The command name '{0}' includes an unapproved verb which might make it less discoverable. The suggested alternative verbs are "{1}".
The contents of file {0} may have been tampered because the hash of the file does not match the hash stored in the digital signature. The script will not execute on the system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.
The current deserialized object size of the data received from remote client exceeded allowed maximum object size. The current deserialized object size is {0}. Allowed maximum object size is {1}.
The current deserialized object size of the data received from remote server exceeded allowed maximum object size. The current deserialized object size is {0}. Allowed maximum object size is {1}.
The current PowerShell host is: '{0}' (version {1}). The module '{2}' requires a minimum PowerShell host version of '{3}' to execute.
The current session does not support debugging; execution will continue.
The EndpointConfiguration with the {0} identifier does not give a valid initial session state on the remote computer. Contact your administrator.
The expression after '{0}' in a pipeline element produced an invalid object. It must result in a command name, script block or CommandInfo object.
The extension '{0}' is not a valid module extension. The supported module extensions are '.dll', '.ps1', '.psm1' and '.psd1'. Correct the extension then try adding the file '{1}' again.
The field/property: "{0}" for type: "{1}" differs only in case from the field/property: "{2}". Failed to use non CLS compliant type.
The file {0} is not digitally signed. The script will not execute on the system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.
The first exception was "{0}" with stack trace "{1}".
The format of the specified snap-in name was not valid.  Windows PowerShell snap-in names can only contain alpha-numeric characters, dashes, underscores and periods. Correct the name and then try the operation again.
The FragmentId's of the same object must be in sequence with increment of 1. This may happen if the fragments are not properly constructed by the remote machine or the data might have been tampered with.
The function or command was called as if it were a method. Parameters should be separated by spaces. For information about parameters, see the about_Parameters Help topic.
The hashtable describing a module contains one or more members that are not valid.  The valid members are ({0}). Remove the members that are not valid ({1}), then try again.
The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for the command either because the command does not take pipeline input or the input and its properties do not match any of the parameters that take pipeline input.
The member '{0}' in the module manifest is invalid: {1}. Please make sure that a valid value is specified for this field in file '{2}'.
The member 'ModuleVersion' is not present in the module manifest. This member must exist and be assigned a version number of the form 'n.n.n.n'. Please add the missing member to the file '{0}'.
The module manifest '{0}' could not be processed because it is not a valid PowerShell restricted language file. Please remove the elements that are not permitted by the restricted language: {1}
The module manifest member 'NestedModules' cannot be used if 'ModuleToProcess' member is a binary module. Please fix the module manifest file at '{0}' and try again.
The module to process '{0}', listed in field '{1}' of module manifest '{2}' was not processed because no valid module was found in any module directory.
The 'ModuleVersion' member is not present in the hashtable describing a module. This member must exist and be assigned a version number of the form 'n.n.n.n'.
The number of characters ({1}) in the argument is too small. Specify an argument whose length is greater than or equal to "{0}" and then try the command again.
The number of supplied arguments ({1}) exceeds the maximum number of allowed arguments ({0}). Specify less than {0} arguments and then try the command again.
The number of supplied arguments ({1}) is less than the minimum number of allowed arguments ({0}). Specify more than {0} arguments and then try the command again.
The online version of this Help topic cannot be displayed because there is no Uri for online Help in the "Related Links" section of the cmdlet Help topic.
The operation cannot be performed because a command has already been started. Wait for the command to complete, or stop it, and then try the operation again.
The path is not in the correct format. Paths may contain only provider and drive names separated by forwardslashes or backslashes.
The path is not in the correct format. Provider paths must contain a provider Id, followed by "::", followed by a provider specific path.
The pipeline has been stopped.
The property already exists.
The required module '{1}' with GUID '{2}' is not loaded. Load the module or remove the module from 'RequiredModules' in the file '{0}'.
The required module '{1}' with version '{2}' is not loaded. Load the module or remove the module from 'RequiredModules' in the file '{0}'.
The runspace pool is closed.
The SafeHandle is not valid.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement at line {1} for Windows PowerShell version {2}. The version required by the script does not match the currently running version of Windows PowerShell version {3}.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement at line {1} with a shell ID of {2} that is incompatible with the current shell.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement at line {1} with a shell ID of {2} that is incompatible with the current shell. To run this script you must use the shell located at '{3}'.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because it contained a "#requires" statement for which there was no valid registration in the Windows Registry for the specified shell ID '{1}'.
The script '{0}' cannot be run because the following snap-ins that are specified by the "#requires" statements of the script are missing: {1}.
The script block cannot be converted, because it contains more than one clause. Expressions or control structures aren't permitted. Make sure the script block contains exactly one pipeline or command.
The script block cannot be invoked because it contains more than one clause. The Invoke() method can only be used on script blocks containing a single clause.
The second exception was "{2}" with stack trace "{3}". Determine why these exception were thrown and try again.
The server process has exited.
The setter method should be public, void, static, and have two parameters. The first parameter should be of type PSObject. The second parameter is needed if a getter method is also available, and should have the same type as the return type for the getter method.
The specified format data file '{0}' could not be processed because the file was not found. Please correct the path and try again.
The specified maximum argument length is smaller than the specified minimum argument length. Update the ValidateLength attribute for the parameter.
The specified maximum number of arguments for a parameter is smaller than the specified minimum number of arguments. Update the ValidateCount attribute for the parameter.
The specified maximum range cannot be accepted because it is less than the specified minimum range. Update the ValidateRange attribute for the parameter.
The specified minimum range ({0}) cannot be accepted because it is not the same type as the specified maximum range ({1}). Update the ValidateRange attribute for the parameter.
-The specified registry subkey does not exist.
The specified type data file '{0}' could not be processed because the file was not found. Please correct the path and try again.
The splatting operator '@' cannot be used to reference variables in an expression. '@{0}' can be used only as an argument to a command. To reference variables in an expression use '${0}'.
The term '{0}' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
The thread options can only be changed if the apartment state is MTA, the current options are UseNewThread or UseCurrentThread and the new value is ReuseThread.
The Use-Transaction cmdlet is intended for scripting of transaction-enabled .NET objects. Its ScriptBlock should contain nothing else.Wx
The ValidateCount attribute cannot be applied to a non-array parameter. Either remove the attribute from the parameter or make the parameter an array parameter.
The ValidateLength attribute cannot be applied to a parameter that is not a string or string[] parameter. Make the parameter a string or string[] parameter.
The version '{0}' of module '{1}' does not meet the required minimum version '{2}'. Please verify the version number and try loading the module again.
The version of the loaded CLR is '{0}'. The module '{1}' requires a minimum CLR version of '{2}' to execute. Please verify the installation of the CLR and try again.
The version of the loaded PowerShell is '{0}'. The module '{1}' requires a minimum PowerShell version of '{2}' to execute. Please verify the installation of the PowerShell and try again.
The WriteObject and WriteError methods cannot be called after the pipeline has been closed. Please contact Microsoft Support Services.
