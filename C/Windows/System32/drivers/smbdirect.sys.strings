Bytes RDMA Read/sec
Bytes RDMA Read/sec is the rate at which bytes are being transferred by RDMA read operations. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Bytes RDMA Written/sec
Bytes RDMA Written/sec is the rate at which bytes are being transferred by RDMA write operations. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
Bytes Received/sec
Bytes Received/sec is the rate at which data is being received from the peer. Data that is directly read from the peer via RDMA read operations is not counted. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the sample interval.

The network adapter '%1' does not support a value of %4 for setting %2\%3. The closest adapter supported value of %5 will be used.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per RDMA read request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per RDMA read request.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per receive queue work request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per receive queue work request.
The network adapter '%1' is incompatible with SMB Direct. Compatible network adapters are required to support at least %2 SGE(s) per send queue work request. This adapter supports a maximum of %3 SGE(s) per send queue work request.
The SMB Direct Connection performance counter set consists of counters that measure connection activity. A computer can have multiple SMB Direct connections. The SMB Direct Connection counter set represents each connection as a pair of IP addresses and ports, where the first IP address/port represents the connection's local endpoint and the second IP address/port represents the connection's remote endpoint.
