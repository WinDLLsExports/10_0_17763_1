CreateVirtualDisk requires only FriendlyName and Size to be specified. Sizes can be specified explicitly through the Size parameter, or you can use the maximum available space from the storage pool by specifying the UseMaximumSize parameter. Both FriendlyName and Size are treated as goals rather than hard requirements. For example, not all SMI-S based arrays support custom friendly names; however, the virtual disk creation will still succeed. If the size specified is not achieved, the actual size used for the virtual disk will be returned in the out parameter structure.

Detach
Detached
DetachedReason
Detaches a Storage Spaces based virtual disk from the system. This operation is similar to Hide, however there is no need for target and initiator configuration since everything is done locally. Detaching a Storage Space will result in it's corresponding disk object to be suprise removed from the system. Note that detaching can happen in response to certain failure and warning conditions (such as failing redundancy, or thin provisioning capacity limits being reached).
Detaching
Determines the allocation behavior for this virtual disk. Enclosure aware virtual disks will intelligently pick the physical disks to use for their redundancy. If TRUE, the virtual disk will attempt to use physical disks from different enclosures to balance the fault tolerance between two (or more) physical enclosures.

If CannotPoolReason contains 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representing the vendor defined reason why this physical disk cannot be added to a concrete pool. This property must be NULL if CannotPoolReason does not contain 1 - 'Other'.
If it is a member of a concrete pool, the health and operational statuses should be reset to 1 - 'Healthy', and 1 - 'OK', respectively. If any additional errors are detected after Reset, the health and operational statuses should reflect these new errors. 
If MaskingValidInitiatorIdTypes contains the value 1 - 'Other', this field is used to enumerate the other valid initiator id types for this storage subsystem.
If OperationalStatus contains 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representing the vendor defined operational status. This property must be NULL if OperationalStatus does not contain 1 - 'Other'.
If RunAsJob is set to TRUE and this method takes a while to execute, this parameter returns a reference to the storage job used to track the long running operation.
If set to a valid access path, the system will attempt to use this path as a way to access the local volume. If the access path could not be set, or this parameter was left NULL, a new access path will be automatically assigned.
If set to TRUE, this instructs the physical disk to enable its indication LED. The indication LED should remain enabled until a second call to Maintenance is made with this parameter specified as FALSE.
If specified, allocation of this virtual disk's storage is limited to the physical disks in the list. These physical disks must already be added to this storage pool.
If the operation that this storage job was tracking has failed, the provider will set this with an error code defined by the method that invoked the operation. If this job tracked a background task, the error code can be set to any valid Storage Management error code as defined in the value map below. If there was no error, this property must be set to 0 - 'Success'. This property should be NULL until the operation has completed.
If the physical disk is not a member of a concrete pool, then this method should not only reset the health and operational statuses, but it should return the disk into a state where it is usable as storage for a concrete pool. For example: If a physical disk had become missing and then has reappeared (after it has been replaced) this physical disk is expected to be in the primordial pool only with an operational status indicating its data is either split or unrecognized. Calling Reset should clear the physical disk of any data, remove any remaining ties to its former concrete pool, and return the disk to a healthy, usable state.
If the SMP is of type 2 - 'SMI-S', this field contains the protocol, computer host name, and port of the SMI-S server. This field will be NULL otherwise.
If the virtual disk's Usage field is set to 1 - 'Other', this field must contain a description of the vendor or user defined usage. If Usage is not set to 1 - 'Other', this field must not be set.
If this field is set to FALSE, the storage pool is a concrete pool. These pools are subject to all of the management operations defined on the storage pool class. This includes creation, deletion, creation of virtual disks, etc.
If this field is set to TRUE, the storage pool is primordial. A primordial pool, also known as the 'available storage' pool is where storage capacity is drawn and returned in the creation and deletion of concrete storage pools. Primordial pools cannot be created or deleted. 
If this property is set to TRUE, the operating system does not assign a drive letter automatically when the partition is discovered. This is only honored for GPT disks and is assumed to be FALSE for MBR disks. This attribute is useful in storage area network (SAN) environments.
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is a shadow copy of another partition. This attribute is used by the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS). This attribute is an indication for file system filter driver-based software (such as antivirus programs) to avoid attaching to the volume. An application can use this attribute to differentiate a shadow copy partition from a production partition. For example, an application that performs a fast recovery will break a shadow copy virtual disk by clearing the read-only and hidden attributes and this attribute. This attribute is set when the shadow copy is created and cleared when the shadow copy is broken.
If this property is set to TRUE, the partition is not detected by the mount manager. As a result, the partition does not receive a drive letter, does not receive a volume GUID path, does not host volume mount points, and is not enumerated by calls to FindFirstVolume and FindNextVolume. This ensures that applications such as disk defragmenter do not access the partition. The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) uses this attribute on its shadow copies.
If TRUE the file server will support continuously available file shares.
If TRUE the server supports file share creation.
If TRUE the share data transmission is encrypted.
If TRUE the share is continuously available.
If TRUE, all resiliency settings will be copied from the primordial pool and added to a concrete pool upon its creation. If FALSE, the storage pool should copy the setting specified in the ResiliencySettingNameDefault parameter of CreateStoragePool. If no name was given, the resiliency setting specified by the primordial pool's ResiliencySettingNameDefault property should be used.
If TRUE, storage pools on this subsystem support capacity expansion through adding more physical disks.
If TRUE, storage pools on this subsystem support the replacement or removal of physical disks by use of the RemovePhysicalDisk method on the storage pool instance.
If TRUE, the CreateVirtualDisk method on the storage subsystem is supported.
If TRUE, the storage job will be automatically deleted after a short time interval.
If TRUE, the storage pool should clear (zero out) physical disks that are removed from the pool.
If TRUE, the storage provider supports the use of the DeviceNumbers parameter of the CreateMaskingSet and AddVirtualDisk methods.
If TRUE, the storage subsystem supports showing and hiding (masking) a virtual disk to a host initiator through the Show/Hide methods of the virtual disk and by the use of masking sets.
If TRUE, the storage subsystem will automatically retire missing physical disks in this storage pool and replace them with hot-spares or other available physical disks (in the storage pool).
If TRUE, the subsystem will only allow one initiator to be added to a masking set.
If TRUE, this field instructs the storage provider (or subsystem) to automatically pick what it determines to be the best number of columns for the virtual disk. If this field is TRUE, then the NumberOfColumns parameter must be NULL.
If TRUE, this storage job represents an automated background task initiated by the storage subsystem. For all user / management initiated operations, this value should be set to FALSE.
If TRUE, this storage pool supports data deduplication.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the ability to create new concrete storage pools from one or more physical disks. If FALSE, either the subsystem uses pre-created storage pools, or it does not support storage pools.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the ability to create new storage tiers. If FALSE, either the subsystem uses pre-created storage tiers, or it does not support storage tiers.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the creation of tiered virtual disks.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the deletion of its storage pools.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the deletion of storage tiers.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the modification of the storage tier friendly name.
If TRUE, this subsystem supports the resizing of storage tiers.
If TRUE, this virtual disk will only be attached to the system if an explicit call is made to the Attach method. Note that this property is specific to Storage Spaces.
If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this field contains the string representation of the vendor defined usage for the storage pool. This property must be NULL if Usage is not set to 1 - 'Other'.
If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this parameter takes in the string representation of a vendor defined usage for this storage pool. This parameter must not be set if Usage is a value other than 1 - 'Other'.
If Usage is set to 1 - 'Other', this parameter takes in the string representation of a vendor defined usage for this virtual disk. This parameter must not be set if Usage is a value other than 1 - 'Other'.

Indicates the total number of bytes being processed by this job.
Indicates the total physical storage size of the disk in bytes
Indicates the total sum of all the capacity used by this storage pool. If the pool is primordial, this will be the sum of all capacity currently allocated to concrete storage pools. If the pool is concrete, this value should be the sum of all capacity currently allocated to virtual disks and other pool metadata.
Indicates whether or not the storage pool is used in a clustered environment.
Indicates whether or not the storage pool's configuration is read-only. If TRUE, the storage pool will not allow configuration changes to itself or any of its virtual and physical disks. Note that the data on the virtual disk may still be writable.

Indicates which address formats can be inferred by the storage provider and subsystem when working with initiator ids.
Indication
Individual settings of the resiliency setting can be overridden using the NumberOfDataCopies, PhysicalDiskRedundancy, NumberOfColumns, and Interleave parameters. If these parameters are not used, the defaults from the resiliency setting will be used. These overrides will not persist back to the particular resiliency setting instance; however some storage providers may choose to create a new resiliency setting instance to capture this new configuration. If any of the goals specified in the override parameters are out of range, or are not supported by the storage pool, an error will be returned.

ObjectId
ObjectId is a mandatory property that is used to opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of a class. ObjectIds must be unique within the scope of the management server (which is hosting the provider). The ObjectId is created and maintained for use of the Storage Management Providers and their clients to track instances of objects. If an object is visible through two different paths (for example: there are two separate Storage Management Providers that point to the same storage subsystem) then the same object may appear with two different ObjectIds. For determining if two object instances are the same object, refer to the UniqueId property.

Storage arrival events are used whenever a storage object is added or created.
Storage Capacity Problem
Storage departure events are used whenever a storage object is removed or deleted.
Storage jobs represent long running operations on a storage subsystem. These operations can either be user-initiated through the various management interfaces defined by this MOF, or automatically by intelligent storage subsystems.
Storage modification events are used when the underlying state of an object has changed. Not all properties should be tracked (for example AllocatedSize may change so frequently that sending events would be impractical). At a minimum, an event should be sent any time an objects HealthStatus or OperationalStatus properties change.

This method creates a point in time snapshot of the virtual disk.
This method creates a storage pool from available physical disks contained within a common primordial pool. A physical disk is available for storage pool creation if its CanPool property is set to TRUE. Storage pool creation is only available when the SupportsStoragePoolCreation field of the storage subsystem is TRUE.
This method creates a virtual disk and single volume using the resources of the storage pool.
This method creates a virtual disk using the resources of the storage pool. This method is available only when the SupportsVirtualDiskCreation property on the storage subsystem is set to TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, this method will fail with MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED. This method is also not supported for primordial pools. 
This method deletes an empty storage pool. If the storage pool contains any virtual disks, these virtual disks should be removed first.
This method deletes the masking set instance.
This method deletes the storage tier.This method is available only when the SupportsStorageTierDeletion propertyon the storage subsystem is set to TRUE. If it is set to FALSE, this methodwill fail with MI_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED.
This method deletes the virtual disk. After this method is called, the space used by the virtual disk will be reclaimed and the user will be unable to reverse the delete operation.
This method hides a virtual disk from an initiator. This operation is also known as 'unexposing' or 'masking' a virtual disk.
This method initiates a repair of the virtual disk - restoring data and redundancy to different (or new) physical disks within the storage pool.
This method removes a virtual disk from the masking set. Once removed, this virtual disk will no longer be shown to the initiators contained in this masking set.
This method removes one or more initiator ids from the masking set. Note that the initiator id instances themselves should not be deleted from the system.
This method removes one or more physical disks from the pool and returns all previously allocated space on the disk to the available capacity in the primordial pool.
This method removes one or more target ports from the masking set.
This method resets the health and operational status of the physical disk. Exact behavior of this method is dependent on whether this physical disk belongs to a concrete pool. 
This method returns the security descriptor that controls access to this specific object instance.
This method returns the supported sizes for a new storage tier. These sizes can either be returned in an array of all supported sizes, through a min, max, and divisor, or both.
This method returns the supported sizes for a virtual disk created on this storage pool. These sizes can either be returned in an array of all supported sizes, through a min, max, and divisor, or both.

This method will remove one or more physical disks from manual allocation.
This method will upgrade the version of the storage pool.
This operation is not supported on primordial storage pools.
This output parameter will contain an array of all of the supported sizes by the storage pool. This parameter may be NULL if the number of supported sizes is large, but is useful for storage pools that support only a select number of virtual disk sizes.
This output parameter will contain an array of all of the supported sizes for the storage tier. This parameter may be NULL if the number of supported sizes is large, but is useful for storage tiers that only support a select number of tier sizes.
This parameter allows the user to specify the desired FriendlyName at the time of the virtual disk creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. Note that some storage subsystems do not allow setting a friendly name during virtual disk creation. If a subsystem doesn't support this, virtual disk creation should still succeed, however the disk may have a different name assigned to it.
This parameter allows the user to specify the desired FriendlyName for the masking set at the time of its creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not requried to be unique.

This parameter allows the user to specify the FriendlyName at the time of the volume creation. FriendlyNames are expected to be descriptive, however they are not required to be unique. The filesystem's label will also be set to this friendly name.
This parameter denotes the maximum supported size that a tier created in this pool can be.
This parameter denotes the maximum supported size that a virtual disk created in this pool can be.
This parameter denotes the minimum supported size that a tier created in this pool can be.
This parameter denotes the minimum supported size that a virtual disk created in this pool can be.
This parameter indicates the default allocation policy for virtual disks created in an enclosure aware storage pool. For example, an enclosure aware subsystem could balance each data copy of the virtual disk across multiple physical enclosures such that each enclosure contains a full data copy of the virtual disk.
This parameter indicates the default logical sector size for the storage pool. This is useful when a storage pool may contain a mix of 512 emulated and either 4K native or 512 native physical disks.
This parameter indicates the interval in which the supported sizes increment. For example: If the minimum supported size is 10 GB, and this parameter is 2 GB, then the supported sizes for this pool would be 10 GB, 12 GB, 14 GB, etc. until the maximum supported size is reached.
This parameter indicates the provisioning type to be used by default when creating a new virtual disk on this storage pool. If no default is specified, the default is inherited from the primordial pool.
This parameter indicates the resiliency setting to be used by default when creating a new virtual disk on this storage pool. If the subsystem's SupportsMultipleResiliencySettingsPerStoragePool property is set to FALSE, this parameter also acts as a hint to the Storage Management Provider on which resiliency setting should be inherited by this storage pool. If no value is given, it is up to the Storage Management Provider to pick the most appropriate resiliency setting.
This parameter is an array of initiator addresses. For each address contained in this array, a corresponding initiator ID instance should be created and then associated with this masking set.
This parameter is used to specify an array of physical disk objects that will be used as the backing data storage for the created storage pool. The physical disks must come from a primordial pool on the subsystem on which you are creating this pool. Only the disks from a single primordial pool may be used.
This parameter returns a reference to the storage job used to track the long running operation.
This parameter returns a reference to the storage job used to track the long running operation. When the operation has completed, an association should exist between the storage job and the created objects.
This parameter specifies the initiators for which the virtual disks should be shown. If the subsystem's MaskingOneInitiatorIdPerView property is TRUE, only one initiator can be specified for this masking set. The list of valid initiator address formats can be determined through the subsystem's MaskingValidInitiatorIdTypes property.
This parameter specifies the level of access the initiator should have to each virtual disk specified by VirtualDiskNames. This parameter has a 1:1 mapping with the VirtualDiskNames parameter (the arrays must be the same length and have the same order).
This parameter specifies the list of virtual disks to show to the initiators in the masking set. The identifier used by this parameter is the virtual disk Name property. This parameter has a 1:1 mapping with the DeviceAccesses parameter (the arrays must be the same length and have the same order).
This parameter specifies the resiliency setting to use as a template for this virtual disk. This property's value should correspond with the particular resiliency setting instance's Name property. Only resiliency settings associated with this storage pool may be used.
This parameter specifies the resiliency setting to use as a template for this volume. This property's value should correspond with the particular resiliency setting instance's Name property. Only resiliency settings associated with this storage pool may be used.
This parameter specifies the target ports which should be used when showing the virtual disks to the initiators. The number of target ports that can be specified depends on the subsystem's MaskingPortsPerView property. If MaskingPortsPerView is set to 4 - 'All target ports share the same view', this parameter is essentially ignored as all target ports on the system will be associated with this masking set.
This property defines the status codes that MAY be return by a conforming CIM Server or Listener. Note that not all status codes are valid for each operation. The specification for each operation SHOULD define the status codes that may be returned by that operation. 
This property indicates how the operating system will proceed with repairing of virtual disks for this storage pool.
This property indicates the partition's GPT type. This property is only valid when the disk's PartitionStyle property is set to 2 - 'GPT' and will be NULL for all other partition styles.
This property indicates the partition's MBR type. This property is only valid when the disk's PartitionStyle property is set to 1 - 'MBR' and will be NULL for all other partition styles.
This property indicates the partition's offset from the beginning of the disk, measured in bytes.
This property indicates whether the disks comprising this pool are able to tolerate power loss without data loss, e.g. automatically flush volatile buffers to non-volatile media after external power is disconnected.
This property indicates whether the times represented in the StartTime, TimeOfLastStateChange, and TimeSubmitted properties represent local times or UTC times. Time values are synchronized worldwide by using the enumeration value 2 - 'UTC Time'.
This property is a string representation of the partition's GPT GUID. This property is only valid if the disk's PartitionStyle property is set to 2 - 'GPT' and will be NULL for all other partition stlyes.
This property is an array of all the various mount points for the partition. This list includes drive letters, as well as mounted folders.
This property is identical to the ObjectId field of the disk object that contains this partition.
This subsystem does not support creation of virtual disks with the specified provisioning type.

UniqueId
UniqueId is a mandatory property that is used to uniquely identify a logical instance of a storage subsystem's object. This value must be the same for an object viewed by two or more provider instances (even if they are running on seperate management servers). UniqueId can be any globally unique, opaque value unless otherwise specified by a derived class.
UniqueIdFormat
UniqueIdFormat indicates the type of identifier used in the UniqueId field. The identifier used in UniqueId must be the highest available identifier using the following order of preference: 8 (highest), 3, 2, 1, 0 (lowest). For example: if the physical disk device exposes identifiers of type 0, 1, and 3, UniqueId must be the identifier of type 3, and UniqueIdFormat should be set to 3.
